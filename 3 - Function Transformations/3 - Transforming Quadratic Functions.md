Transforming Quadratic Functions
-------


### Factored Form

Recall the factored form of a quadratic relation: f(x) = a(x - s)(x - t).

When we plug in values for s and t, but not a, we have a family of quadratic functions that have the same roots.

The value of a determines two things: stretch/compression and reflection.

If magnitude of a determines how much the function stretches or compresses. The sign of a determines whether there is a reflection along the x-axis.


### Vertex Form

Recall the vertex form of a quadratic relation: f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k.

When we plug in values for a, h, and k, we have a transformation of f(x) = x^2.

The vertex is at (h, k), and the equation for the axis of symmetry is x = h.
