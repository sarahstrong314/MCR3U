Families of Functions
-------

### Definitions

* A **family of functions** is a collection of functions that share the same shape. Two functions share the same shape when one can be transformed into the other by any of the following: shifting, stretching/compressing, and reflecting.

 Examples of families of functions: linear functions, quadratic functions, cubic functions, reciprocal functions, radical functions (given the base), exponential functions (given the base), sinusoidal functions.
 
 Nonexamples of families of functions: rational functions, polynomial functions, trigonometric functions.

* A **parent function** is the "simplest" function in a family of functions.

| Family of Functions| Parent Function |
| --- | --- |
| linear | f(x) = x |
| quadratic | f(x) = x^2 |
| cubic | f(x) = x^3 |
| reciprocal | f(x) = 1/x |
| squareroot | f(x) = \sqrt(x) |
| cuberoot | f(x) = \cuberoot(x) |
| exponential (base 2) | f(x) = 2^x |
| exponential (base 3) | f(x) = 3^x |
| logarithmic (base 2) | f(x) = log_2(x) |
| logarithmic (base 3) | f(x) = log_3(x) |
| sinusoidal | f(x) = sin(x) |

* The **transformations of a function** are the transformations that have been applied to the parent function. There are three categories of transformations: shifting, compressing, and reflecting.
