Applying Function Transformations
-------

Recall the various function transformations:

* vertical shift
* horizontal shift
* vertical stretches/compressions
* horizontal stretches/compressions
* reflections

To apply any combinations of these transformations, here is the formula:

g(x) = a f(k(x - h)) + c

g(x) is the transformed function and f(x) is the parent function.

Here is what it looks like for f(x) = x, f(x) = x^2, f(x) = sqrt(x), f(x) = 1/x, f(x) = 2^x, f(x) = sin(x), and f(x) = cos(x).

| Parent Function | Transformed Function |
| --- | --- |
| f(x) = x | g(x) = a(k(x - h)) + c |
| f(x) = x^2 | g(x) = a(k(x - h))^2 + c |
| f(x) = 1/x | g(x) = a/(k(x - h)) + c |
| f(x) = \sqrt(x) | g(x) = a sqrt(k(x - h)) + c |
| f(x) = 2^x | g(x) = a2^(k(x - h)) + c |
| f(x) = sin(x) | g(x) = asin(k(x - h)) + c |
| f(x) = cos(x) | g(x) = acon(k(x - h)) + c |
