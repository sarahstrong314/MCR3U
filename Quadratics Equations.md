[New] Solving Quadratic Equations
– expand and simplify second-degree polynomial expressions [e.g., (2x + 5)^2, (2x – y)(x + 3y)], using a variety of tools (e.g., algebra tiles, diagrams, computer algebra systems, paper and pencil) and strategies (e.g., patterning)
– factor polynomial expressions involving common factors, trinomials, and differences of squares, using a variety of tools and strategies
– determine, through investigation, and describe the connection between the factors of a quadratic expression and the x-intercepts (i.e., the zeros) of the graph of the corresponding quadratic relation, expressed in the form y = a(x – r)(x – s);
– interpret real and non-real roots of quadratic equations, through investigation using graphing technology, and relate the roots to the x-intercepts of the corresponding relations;
– express y = ax2 + bx + c in the form y = a(x – h)2 + k by completing the square in situations involving no fractions, using a variety of tools (e.g. concrete materials, diagrams, paper and pencil);
– sketch or graph a quadratic relation whose equation is given in the form y = ax2 + bx + c, using a variety of methods (e.g., sketching y = x2 – 2x – 8 using intercepts and symmetry; sketching y = 3x2 – 12x + 1 by completing the square and applying transformations; graphing h = –4.9t2 + 50t + 1.5 using technology);
– explore the algebraic development of the quadratic formula (e.g., given the algebraic development, connect the steps to a numerical example; follow a demonstration of the algebraic development [student reproduction of the development of the general case is not required]);
– solve quadratic equations that have real roots, using a variety of methods (i.e., factoring, using the quadratic formula, graphing)
