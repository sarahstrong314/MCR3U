Polynomials

### Definitions

* A **polynomial** is a sum of terms. Examples of polynomials: $3x + x^2$, $8 + xy + y^2 + x^2y$, $3 + x + 7 + x^2 + 2x$.

* A **reduced polynomial** is a polynomial that cannot be simplified further. Examples of reduced polynomials: $3x + x^2$, $2 + y + x$. Nonexamples of reduced polynomials: $2x + 8x$, $-x^2 + x + 3x^2$.

* The **leading term** in a polynomial is the term with the highest degree when the polynomial has been reduced. Example: $x^4$ is the leading term of $7x^3 + 6x + x^4$.

* The **degree of a polynomial** is the degree of its leading term when the polynomial has been reduced. Example: 4 is the degree of $7x^3 + 6x + x^4$.

 
### Simplifying Polynomials

Recall that a polynomial is a sum of terms. For example, $1 + 2x + x^2$ is a polynomial because 1, $2x$, and $x^2$ are all terms.  $1 - 2x + x^2$ is also a polynomial because it is the sum of 1$,$ $-2x$, and $x^2$, which are all terms. 

We can simplify polynomials by adding all the sets of like terms. For example, we can simplify $-3 + x + y^2 + 2x$ to $ -3 + 3x + y^2$.


### Types of Polynomials

The word "polynomial" comes from two Greek words: "polys" (many) and "nomos" (part). The "parts" in this case are the terms.

There are different names for polynomials with a certain number of terms.

* A **monomial** is a reduced polynomial with *one* term.

* A **binomial** is a reduced polynomial with *two* terms.

* A **trinomial** is a reduced polynomial with *three* terms.


"Monos" means single in Greek, "bis" means twice in Latin, and "tres" means three in Latin.
