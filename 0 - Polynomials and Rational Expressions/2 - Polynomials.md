Polynomials
-------

### Definitions

* A **polynomial** is a sum of terms. Examples of polynomials: $3x + x^2$, $8 + xy + y^2 + x^2y$, $3 + x + 7 + x^2 + 2x$.

* A **simplified polynomial** is a polynomial that cannot be simplified further. Examples of simplified polynomials: $3x + x^2$, $2 + y + x$. Nonexamples of simplified polynomials: $2x + 8x$, $-x^2 + x + 3x^2$.

* The **leading term** in a polynomial is the term with the highest degree when the polynomial has been simplified. Example: $x^4$ is the leading term of $7x^3 + 6x + x^4$.

* The **degree of a polynomial** is the degree of its leading term when the polynomial has been simplified. Example: 4 is the degree of $7x^3 + 6x + x^4$.

Fill in the table below by describing each of the polynomials.

| Polynomial | Leading Term | Degree |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| $x + y$| | |
| $4x^2 + x^3$ | | |
| $x^5 + 7x^6 + x^2$ | | |
| $x + y + 2xy + xy^3$ | | |

Example: Is $1 - 2x + x^2$ a polynomial? 
Yes. It is the sum of 1, $-2x$, and $x^2$, which are all terms. 

Example: Is $\frac{1}{x} - 2x + x^2$ a polynomial?
No. It is the sum of $\frac{1}{x}, $-2x$, and $x^2$, but $\frac{1}{x}$ is not a term. 


### Simplifying Polynomials


We can simplify polynomials by adding all the sets of like terms. For example, we can simplify $-3 + x + y^2 + 2x$ to $ -3 + 3x + y^2$.


Simplify the following polynomials.

1. $x + 4y + 2x + x^2$

2. $2 + x^3 + 4 + y^2 + y^2$

3. $x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x^3 + y$.


### Types of Polynomials

The word "polynomial" comes from two Greek words: "polys" (many) and "nomos" (part). The "parts" in this case are the terms.

There are different names for polynomials with a certain number of terms.

* A **monomial** is a simplified polynomial with *one* term.

* A **binomial** is a simplified polynomial with *two* terms.

* A **trinomial** is a simplified polynomial with *three* terms.


Just For Fun: "Monos" means single in Greek, "bis" means twice in Latin, and "tres" means three in Latin.

Just For Fun: Quadrinomials and Quinomials are simplified polynomials with four and five terms, respectively.
