How Do We Multiply Polynomials?
-------

### Multiplying Terms

Recall that a term is a product of constants and variables. To multiply two terms, we multiply the constants and variables they are made up of.

Example: Multiply $3x$ and $4x^2$.

Since $3x$ is $3 \times x$ and and $4x^2$ is $4 \times x \times x$, multiplying the two terms gives $3 \times x \times 4 \times x \times x$, which is to get 12x^3$.

Example: Find the product of $-3x^2y$ and 2x^3y^2$.

$-3x^2y \times 2x^3y^2 = -6x^5y^3$.


Multiply the following terms.

1. $2x$ and $3x^2$

2. $2xy$ and $4x^2$

3. $3x^3$ and $5y$.


### Multiplying Polynomials

To multiply a monomial by a polynomial, multiply the monomial by each term in the polynomial, then add them all together. 

Example: Multiply $3x$ and $-7 + 2x - x^2$.

Multiplying the $3x$ by every term in the polynomial gives $3x(-7) + 3x(2x) + 3x(-x^2)$, which simplifies to $-21x + 6x^2 - 3x^3$.

To multiply a binomial by a polynomial, multiply the first term in the binomial by the polynomial, then multiply the second term in the binomial by the polynomial, then add them all together. Another way to think of it is that $(a + b)P$, where $P$ is a polynomial, is equivalent to $aP + bP$, so we can repeat the process of multiplying a monomial with a polynomial twice.

Example: Multiply $2 + 3x$ and $-7 + 2x - x^2$.

Multiplying $2$ by every term in the second polynomial gives  $2(-7) + 2(2x) + 2(-x^2)$. Multiplying $3x$ by every term in the second polynomial gives $3x(-7) + 3x(2x) + 3x(-x^2)$. Adding those two results together gives $-14 + 4x + -2x^2 + -21x + 6x^2 - 3x^4$, which simplifies to $-14 - 17x + 5x^2 - 3x^3$.

In general, to multiply two polynomials, we multiply each term in the first polynomial by the second polynomial, then add them all together. In this course, the most complex case will have to deal with is multiplying a binomial by a polynomial.

Multiply the following polynomials.

1. $3 + 2x$ and $4$

2. $3 + 2x$ and $5 - x$

3. $3 + 2x$ and $3 + x - 2x^2$.
