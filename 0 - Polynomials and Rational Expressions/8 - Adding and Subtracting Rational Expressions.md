Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions

### Lowest Common Multiple

Recall that when adding or subtracting fractions, we have to first get a common denominator. We do the same when adding or subtracting rational expressions.

To get a common denominator, we have to find what is called the **lowest common multiple**. To find the lowest common multiple of two expressions, we first factor them, eliminate any common factors, then multiply all the remaining factors together. For example, the lowest common multiple of $3x^2$ and $6x is 6x^2$, since we eliminate a factor of $3x$ and get $x \times 6 = 6x$.

Here is another example. The lowest common multiple of $(x + 1)(x + 2)$ and $(x - 2)(x + 2)$ is $(x + 1)(x - 2)$ since we eliminate a factor of $(x - 2)$ and multiply the remaining factors together.

Find the lowest common multiple among each of the following polynomials.
1. $(x + 1)$ and $(x + 1)(x - 2)$

2. $(x + 1)(x + 2)$ and $(x + 1)(x - 2)$


### Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions

To add two rational expressions, first find the lowest common multiple of the two denominators. Then multiply the numerator and denominator of each rational expression by the appropriate term to result in the common denominator. Then add the two numerators. We should also state the restrictions in the denominator.

For example, to find $\frac{x^2}{3} + \frac{5}{x}$, we first find the lowest common multiple among the denominators, which is $3x$. Then we rewrite each rational expression using $3x$ as the common denominator to get $\frac{x^3}{3x} + \frac{15}{3x} = \frac{x^3 + 15}{3x}$, $x \ne 0$.

To subtract two rational expressions, follow the same process as adding, except subtract the two numerators in the end instead of adding them.

For example, $\frac{x^2}{3} - \frac{5}{x} = \frac{x^3}{3x} - \frac{15}{3x} = \frac{x^3 - 15}{3x}$, $x \ne 0$.

Add the following rational expressions.
1. $\frac{(x - 3)(x + 2)}{(x - 2)}$ and $\frac{(x + 3)(x - 3)}{(x - 2)^2}$

2. $\frac{2x^2 - 11x + 5}{(x - 2)}$ and $\frac{(x + 3)(x - 1)}{(x - 5)(x + 1)}$

Subtract the following rational expressions.
1. $\frac{(x - 3)(x + 2)}{(x - 2)}$ and $\frac{(x + 3)(x - 3)}{(x - 2)^2}$

2. $\frac{2x^2 - 11x + 5}{(x - 2)}$ and $\frac{(x + 3)(x - 1)}{(x - 5)(x + 1)}$
