Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions

### Lowest Common Multiple

Recall that when adding or subtracting fractions, we have to first get a common denominator. We do the same when adding or subtracting rational expressions.

To get a common denominator, we have to find what is called the **lowest common multiple**, abbreviated LCM. 

To find the LCM of two terms, we find the LCM among the coefficients, then the LCM among the variables with their respective degrees. The two results are then multiplied together.

Example: Find the lowest common multiple of $3x^2$ and $6x$.

The LCM of 3 and 6 is 6, and the LCM of $x^2$ and $x$ is $x^2$, so the LCM of the two terms is $6x^2$

To find the LCM of two factored polynomials, we take all the unique factors to the highest degree from either polynomial. All the results are then multiplied together.

Example: Find the lowest common multiple of $(x + 1)(x + 2)$ and $(x - 2)(x + 2)$.

The LCM is $(x + 1)(x + 2)(x - 2)$, since each factor has a highest degree of 1.


Example: Find the lowest common multiple of $(x + 1)^2(x + 2)$ and $(x - 2)(x + 2)^2$.

The LCM is $(x + 1)^2(x + 2)^2(x - 2)$, since the first two factors have a highest degree of 1, and the other has a highest degree of 1.


Find the lowest common multiple among each of the following polynomials.

1. $(x + 1)$ and $(x + 1)(x - 2)$

2. $(x + 1)(x + 2)$ and $(x + 1)(x - 2)$

2. $(x + 1)(x + 2)^2$ and $(x + 1)(x - 2)$


### Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions

To add two rational expressions, first find the lowest common multiple of the two denominators. Then multiply the numerator and denominator of each rational expression by the appropriate term to result in the common denominator. Then add the two numerators. We should also state the restrictions in the denominator.

Example: Add $\frac{x^2}{3}$ and $\frac{5}{x}$.

The lowest common multiple among the denominators is $3x$. Rewriting each rational expression using $3x$ as the common denominator gives $\frac{x^3}{3x} + \frac{15}{3x}$. Adding them gives $\frac{x^3 + 15}{3x}$, with the restriction $x \ne 0$.

To subtract two rational expressions, follow the same process as adding, except subtract the two numerators in the end instead of adding them.

Example: Subtract $\frac{x^2}{3}$ and $\frac{5}{x}$.

$\frac{x^2}{3} - \frac{5}{x} = \frac{x^3}{3x} - \frac{15}{3x} = \frac{x^3 - 15}{3x}$, $x \ne 0$.

Add the following rational expressions.

1. $\frac{(x - 3)(x + 2)}{(x - 2)}$ and $\frac{(x + 3)(x - 3)}{(x - 2)^2}$

2. $\frac{2x^2 - 11x + 5}{(x - 2)}$ and $\frac{(x + 3)(x - 1)}{(x - 5)(x + 1)}$

Subtract the following rational expressions.

1. $\frac{(x - 3)(x + 2)}{(x - 2)}$ and $\frac{(x + 3)(x - 3)}{(x - 2)^2}$

2. $\frac{2x^2 - 11x + 5}{(x - 2)}$ and $\frac{(x + 3)(x - 1)}{(x - 5)(x + 1)}$
