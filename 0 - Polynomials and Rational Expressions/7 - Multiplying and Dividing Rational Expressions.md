Multiplying and Dividing Rational Expressions
-------


To multiply two rational expressions, first factor any polynomials, if possible. Then multiply both the numerators, then both the denominators. The result can be simplified by removing common factors. The restrictions should also be stated, including ones that have been "cancelled out".

For example, \frac{x^2}{3} × \frac{5}{x} = \frac{5x^2}{3x} = \frac{5x}{3}, x ≠ 0.

To divide two rational expressions, multiply the first one by the reciprocal of the second one.

For example, \frac{x^2}{3} \div \frac{5}{x} = \frac{x^2}{3} × \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x^3}{15}.
