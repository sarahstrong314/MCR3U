Adding and Subtracting Polynomials

### Adding Polynomials

Recall that we can simplify polynomials by adding the like terms. For example, we can simplify the polynomial $4 + x - 3x$ by adding the like terms $x$ and $-3x$ to get $2x$. The result is $4 - 2x$.

To add two polynomials, we first combine them into one polynomial, then we simplify it. For example, to add $3 + 4x$ and $-7 + 2x + x^2$, we first combine them to get $3 + 4x + -7 + 2x + x^2$, then we simplify it to get $-4 + 6x + x^2$.

Here is another example.
$(1 + 3x + 2x^2) + (2 - 2x + x^2) = 1 + 3x + 2x^2 + 2 - 2x + x^2 = 1 + 2 + 3x - 2x + 2x^2 + x^2 = 3 + x + 3x^2$.

Add the following polynomials.

1. $1 + 2x + 3x^2$ and $4 + 2x + x^2$

2. $2 + x^3$ and $4 + x^2 + 2x^3$

3. $x^3 + x^2$ and $3x^3 + 1$.


### Subtracting Polynomials

In order to subtract polynomials, we first have to understand that we cannot simply combine them with a subtraction sign instead of an addition sign like we do when adding polynomials. When a polynomial is subtracted from another, every single one of its terms is subtracted, so we have to negate each term before combining the two polynomials.

For example, to subtract $3 + 4x$ and $-7 + 2x + x^2$, we first negate the second polynomial to get $7 - 2x - x^2$, then combine them to get $3 + 4x + 7 - 2x - x^2$, then we can simplify it to get $10 + 2x - x^2$.

Here is another example.
$(1 + 3x + 2x^2) - (2 - 2x + x^2) = 1 + 3x + 2x^2 - 2 + 2x - x^2 = 1 - 2 + 3x + 2x + 2x^2 - x^2 = -1 + 5x + x^2$.

Subtract the following polynomials.

1. $1 + 2x + 3x^2$ and $4 + 2x + x^2$

2. $2 + x^3$ and $4 + x^2 + 2x^3$

3. $x^3 + x^2$ and $3x^3 + 1$.
