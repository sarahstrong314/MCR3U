Simplifying Rational Expressions
-------


A **rational expression** is an fraction in which both the numerator and denominator are polynomial expressions.

A rational expression is simplified when and all common factors among the numerator and denominator have been cancelled out. They can be in either expanded or factored form.

For example, the rational expression $\frac{(x + 1)(x - 3)}{x + 2}$ is simplified.

Since we cannot divide by 0, there may be restrictions for the variables in the denominator. If the denominator is factorable, we can find the restrictions by factoring it and finding the root of each factor. 

For example, the restriction of $\frac{(x + 1)(x - 3)}{x + 2}$ is $x \ne 2$.
