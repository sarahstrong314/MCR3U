Simplifying Rational Expressions
-------


A **rational expression** is an fraction in which both the numerator and denominator are polynomial expressions.

A rational expression is simplified when and all common factors among the numerator and denominator have been cancelled out. They can be in either expanded or factored form.

Since we cannot divide by 0, there may be restrictions for the variables in the denominator. If the denominator is factorable, we can find the restrictions by factoring it and finding the root of each factor. 

Example: What are the restrictions of $\frac{(x + 1)(x - 3)}{x + 2}$?

The only restriction is $x \ne 2$, since that is the only value in which the denominator is 0.


Simplify each of the following rational expressions and state their restrictions.

1. $\frac{x^2 + 7x + 10}{x + 5}$

2. $\frac{2x^2 - 3x - 9}{(2x + 3)(-x + 5)}$

Two algebraic expressions are **equivalent** if they can be simplified to the same expression, with the same restrictions.
