Terms

### Definitions

* A **constant** is a fixed value. Constants can sometimes be denoted by a letter when the value is unknown or too long to write. Examples of constants: 1000, -29, $\frac{1}{2}$, 4.19374, $\pi$, $\sqrt{2}$, $\frac{-25}{3}$.

* A **variable** is a nonfixed value, often denoted by a letter near the end of the alphabet, such as $x$ or $y$.

* A **term** is an algebraic expression that is a product of constants and variables. A constant at the front of a term is called a **coefficient**. 

* The **degree of a term** is the sum of the exponents to which the variables are raised. If a term does not contain a variable, its degree is 0. Examples: the degree of $2x^3$ is 3, the degree of $-x$ is 1, and the degree of $4x^2y^3$ is 5.
 
* Two or more terms are **like terms** if they contain the same variables with the same degrees. Examples of like terms: -4 and 5, $x$ and $2x$, $-7xy^2$ and $-4xy^2$, $x^3$ and $3x^3$.

Which of the following are examples of terms? For each of the six terms, fill in a row in the table below.

9, $x$, $2x$, $-7xy$, $\frac{1}{x}$, $\frac{x}{2}$, $x^3$, $x^3.5$, $\sqrt{x}$.

### Expanded Form of Terms 

Recall that a term is a product of constants and variables. For example, $8x^2$ is a term because $8x^2$ = $8 \times x \times x$.

Here is a table showing terms in expanded form.

| Term | Expanded form of term |
| --- | --- | 
| 2 | 2 |
| $x$ | $x$ |
| $2x$ | $2 \times x$ |
| $x^2$ | $x \times x$|
| $2x^2$ | $2 \times x \times x$|
| $2xy$ | $2 \times x \times y$ |
| $2x^2y$ | $2 \times x \times x \times y$ |

Fill in the table below by writing out each term in expanded form.

| Term | Expanded form of term |

| $xy$ | |
| $x^3$ | |
| $x^2y$ | |
