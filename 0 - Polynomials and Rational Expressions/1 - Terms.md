Terms

### Definitions

* A **constant** is a fixed value. Constants can sometimes be denoted by a letter when the value is unknown or difficult to write. Examples of constants: $1000$, $-29$, $\frac{1}{2}$, $4.19374$, $\pi$, $\sqrt{2}$, $\frac{-25}{3}$.

* A **variable** is a nonfixed value, often denoted by a letter near the end of the alphabet. Examples of variables: $x$, $y$, $z$.

* A **term** is an algebraic expression that is a product of constants and variables. A constant in front of a variable is called a **coefficient**. Examples of terms: $9$, $x$, $2x$, $-7xy$, $\frac{x}{2}, $x^3$. Nonexamples of terms: $\frac{1}{x}$, $\sqrt{x}$, $x^3.5$.

* The **degree of a term** is the sum of the exponents to which the variables are raised. If a term does not contain a variable, its degree is $0$. Examples: The degree of $2x^3$ is $3$, the degree of $-x$ is $1$, the degree of $4x^2y^3$ is $5$.
 
* Two or more terms are **like terms** if they contain the same variables with the same degrees. Examples of like terms: $-4$ and $5$, $x$ and $2x$, $-7xy^2$ and $-4xy^2$, $x^3$ and $3x^3$. Nonexamples of terms: $x$ and $x^2$, $2$ and $x$, $x^2$ and $x^3$.  

Fill in the table below by writing the descriptions of each given term.
 
| Term | Constant, variable, or neither? | Degree of term | Variables | Example of a like term |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $3$ | | | | |
| $x$ | | | | |
| $x^2$ | | | | |
| $xy$ | | | | |
| $2x^3$ | | | | |
| $-x^2y$ | | | | |
 
 
### Expanded Form of Terms 

Recall that a term is a product of constants and variables. For example, $8x^2$ is a term because $8x^2$ = $8 \times x \times x$.

Here is a table showing terms in expanded form.

| Term | Expanded form of term |
| --- | --- | 
| $2$ | $2$ |
| $x$ | $x$ |
| $2x$ | $2 \times x$ |
| $x^2$ | $x \times x$|
| $2x^2$ | $2 \times x \times x$|
| $2xy$ | $2 \times x \times y$ |
| $2x^2y$ | $2 \times x \times x \times y$ |

Fill in the table below by writing out each term in expanded form.
