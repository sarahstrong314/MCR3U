Vertical and Horizontal Shifts
-------

### Vertical Shifts

A **vertical shift** is a transformation resulting from a constant being added to a function. 

This constant is often denoted $c$. When $c$ is positive, it is an upwards shift. When $c$ is negative, it is a downwards shift.
 
Example: Describe $f(x) + 3$ and $f(x) - 3$ in terms of transformations of $f(x)$.

$f(x) + 3$ is a vertical shift of 3 upwards, $f(x) - 3$ is a vertical shift of 3 downwards.
 
 
### Horizontal Shifts

A **horizontal shift** is a transformation resulting from the independent variable being replaced by itself minus a constant. 

This constant is denoted $h$. When $h$ is positive, it is a shift to the right. When $h$ is negative, it is a shift to the left.


Example: Describe $f(x + 3)$ and $f(x - 3)$ in terms of transformations of $f(x)$.

$f(x + 3)$ is a horizontal shift of 3 to the left, and $f(x - 3)$ is a horizontal shift of 3 to the right.


Describe the transformation(s) of each of the following functions from $g(x)$.

1. $g(x - 2)$

2. $g(x) - 3$

3. $g(x + 1) - 4$


Describe the transformation of each of the following functions from its parent function, state its domain and range, and sketch both it and its parent function on the same set of axes.

1. $f(x) = x + 4$

2. $f(x) = (x + 3)^2$

3. $f(x) = \sqrt{x + 1} - 2$
