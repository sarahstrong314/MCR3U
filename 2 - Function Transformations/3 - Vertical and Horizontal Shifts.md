Vertical and Horizontal Shifts
-------

### Vertical Shifts

A **vertical shift** is a transformation resulting from a constant being added to a function. 

This constant is often denoted $c$. When $c$ is positive, it is an upwards shift. When $c$ is negative, it is a downwards shift.
 
Examples: When comparing the following functions to $f(x)$, the transformation of $f(x) + 3$ is a vertical shift of 3 upwards, and the transformation of $f(x) - 3$ is a vertical shift of 3 downwards.
 
 
### Horizontal Shifts

A **horizontal shift** is a transformation resulting from the independent variable being replaced by itself minus a constant. 

This constant is denoted $h$. When $h$ is positive, it is a shift to the right. When $h$ is negative, it is a shift to the left.

Examples: When comparing the following functions to $f(x)$, the transformation of $f(x - 3)$ is a horizontal shift of 3 to the right, and the transformation of $f(x + 3)$ is a horizontal shift of 3 to the left.


Describe the transformation of each of the following functions from $g(x)$.

1. $g(x - 2)$

2. $g(x) - 3$

3. $g(x + 1) - 4$


Describe the transformation of each of the following functions from its parent function.

1. $f(x) = x + 4$

2. $f(x) = (x + 3)^2$

3. $f(x) = \sqrt{x + 1} - 2$
