Parent Functions
-------


* A **family of functions** is a collection of functions that are transformations of a common shape. Transformations include any of the following: shifting, stretching/compressing, and reflecting.

Examples of families of functions include: linear functions, quadratic functions, cubic functions, absolute value functions, reciprocal functions, and radical functions (given the base).

* A **parent function** is the "simplest" function in a family of functions.

| Family of Functions| Parent Function |
| --- | --- |
| linear | $f(x) = x$ |
| quadratic | $f(x) = x^2$ |
| cubic | $f(x) = x^3$ |
| absolute value | $f(x) = \abs{x}$ |
| reciprocal | $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ |
| squareroot | $f(x) = \sqrt{x)$ |
| cuberoot | $f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}$ |

* The **transformations of a function** are the transformations that have been applied to the parent function. There are three categories of transformations: shifting, compressing, and reflecting.

* The **image of a point** is the point to which it has moved when a transformation has been applied.


Sketch each function and its parent function of each of the following functions? What is the image of the origin in each transformation?

1. $f(x) = (x-3)^2 + 4$

2. $f(x) = \sqrt{x - 5}$

3. $f(x) = \frac{2}{x}$
