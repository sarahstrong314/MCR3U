Stretches, Compressions, and Reflections
-------

### Vertical Stretches and Compressions

A **vertical stretch** or **vertical compression** is a transformation resulting from a constant being multiplied to the function.

This constant is often denoted $k$. When $\abs{a} > 1$, it is a stretch by a factor of $a$. When $ 0 < \abs{a} < 1$, is a compression by a factor of $a$.
 
Examples: When comparing the following functions to $f(x)$, the transformation of $2f(x)$ is a vertical stretch by a factor of 2, and the transformation of $\frac{f(x)}{2}$ is a vertical compression by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$.
 
 
### Horizontal Stretches and Compressions

A **horizontal stretch** or **horizontal compression** is a transformation resulting from a constant being multiplied to the independent variable.

This constant is often denoted $k$. When $\abs{k} > 1$, it is a compression by a factor of $\frac{1}{k}$. When $0 < \abs{k} < 1$, it is a compression by a factor of $\frac{1}{k}$.
 
Examples: When comparing the following functions to f(x), the transformation of $f(2x)$ is a horizontal compression by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$, and the transformation of $f(\frac{x}{2})$ is a horizontal stretch by a factor of $2$.


### Reflection

A **reflection** is a transformation resulting from either the independent variable or the function being multiplied by -1.

If $a$ is negative, it denotes a reflection along the $x$-axis. If $k$ is negative, it denotes a reflection along the $y$-axis.

Examples: When comparing the following functions to $f(x)$, the transformation of $-f(x)$ is a reflection along the $x$-axis, and the transformation of $f(-x)$ is a reflection along the $x$-axis.


Describe the transformation of each of the following functions from g(x).

1. $\frac{1}{3}g(x)$

2. $3g(x)$

3. $g(2x)$

4. $g(\frac{1}{2}x)$

3. $g(-x)$


Describe the transformation of each of the following functions from its parent function, state its domain and range, and sketch both it and its parent function on the same set of axes.

1. $f(x) = \frac{x}{2}$

2. $f(x) = 2(x)^2$

3. $f(x) = -\sqrt{3x}$

4. $f(x) = 4\abs{-x}$

5. $f(x) = \frac{x^2}{-5}$
