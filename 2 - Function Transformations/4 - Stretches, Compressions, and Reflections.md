Stretches, Compressions, and Reflections
-------

### Vertical Stretches and Compressions

A **vertical stretch** or **vertical compression** is a transformation resulting from a constant being multiplied to the independent variable.

This constant is often denoted $k$. When $\abs{k}$ is greater than 1, it is a compression by a factor of $k$. When $\abs{k}$ is between 0 and 1, is a stretch by a factor of $\frac{1}{k}$.
 
Examples: The transformation of $f(x) = (2x)^2$ is a vertical stretch by a factor of 2, the transformation of $f(x) = (\frac{x}{2})^2$ is a vertical compression by a factor of 2.
 
 
### Horizontal Stretches and Compressions

A **horizontal stretch** or **horizontal compression** is a transformation resulting from a constant being multiplied to the function.

This constant is often denoted $a$. When $\abs{a}$ is greater than 1, it is a stretch by a factor of $a$. When $\abs{a}$ is between 0 and 1, is a compression by a factor of $\frac{1}{a}$.
 
Examples: The transformation of $f(x) = 2x^2$ is a horizontal compression by a factor of 2, the transformation of $f(x) = \frac{x^2}{2}$ is a horizontal stretch by a factor of 2.


### Reflection

A **reflection** is a transformation resulting from either the independent variable or the function being multiplied by -1.

If $k$ is negative, it denotes a reflection along the $y$-axis. If a is negative, it denotes a reflection along the $x$-axis.

Examples: The transformation of $f(x) = (-x)^2$ is a reflection along the $y$-axis, the transformation of $f(x) = -x^2$ is a reflection along the $x$-axis.
