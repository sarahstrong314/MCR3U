Inverse of Functions
-------

The **inverse of a function** is the resulting relation when the independent variable and dependent variable are swapped.

There are several different methods to determine the inverse of a function:
1. Write the function as an equation, swap the independent and dependent variable, then rearrange for the dependent variable. 
2. Write the function as a sequence of instructions done to the independent variable, then invert the instructions. Inverting involves taking the opposite of each operation then reversing their order.
3. Graph the function, then reflect it over the line y = x.

Here are examples of each of the methods for f(x) = 3x + 1. Let g be the inverse function.

1. Swapping the independent and dependent variable gives x = 3g(x) + 1, then rearranging gives g(x) = (x - 1)/3.
2. The function involves multiplying the dependent variable by 3, then adding 1. The inverse is subtracting by 1 then dividing by 3, giving g(x) = (x - 1)/3.
3. Graphing f then reflecting it over the line y = x results in a y-intercept of -1/3 and a slope of x/3, so the inverse is g(x) = x/3 - 1/3, which is equivalent to g(x) = (x - 1)/3

When the inverse of a function f is a function itself, it is often denoted by f^-1. We've seen the ^-1 to denote an inverse when we work with inverse trigonometric ratios. In the example above, we would write f(x) = x + 1 and f^-1(x) = x - 1.


### Inverses of Polynomial Functions

The inverse of a linear function is another linear function.

The inverse of a quadratic function is a square root relation.

The inverse of a cubic function is a cube root relation.

The inverse of any polynomial function is a radical relation, which uses the root symbol: âˆš. It will also use the \pm sign.


### Properties of Function Inverses

If f^-1 is the inverse of f, then:

* f is the inverse of f^-1.
* the domain of f is the range of f^-1
* the range of f is the range of f^-1
* f(f^-1(x)) = x
* f^-1(f(x)) = x
