Inverse of Functions
-------

The **inverse of a function** is the resulting relation when the independent variable and dependent variable are swapped.

Invesigation: What patterns do we notice with invereses of linear and quadratic functions? What do you notice when you graph both on the same set of axes?

There are several different methods to determine the inverse of a function:
Method 1. Write the function as an equation, swap the independent and dependent variable, then rearrange for the dependent variable. 
Method 2. Write the function as a sequence of instructions done to the independent variable, then invert the instructions. Inverting involves taking the opposite of each operation then reversing their order.
Method 3. Graph the function, then reflect it over the line $y = x$.

Here are examples of each of the methods for $f(x) = 3x + 1$. Let g be the inverse function.

Method 1. Swapping the independent and dependent variable gives $x = 3g(x) + 1$, then rearranging gives $g(x) = \frac{x - 1}{3}$.
Method 2. The function involves multiplying the dependent variable by 3, then adding 1. The inverse is subtracting by 1 then dividing by 3, giving $g(x) = \frac{x - 1}{3}$.
Method 3. Graphing $f$ then reflecting it over the line $y = x$ results in a $y$-intercept of $\frac{-1}{3}$ and a slope of $\frac{x}{3}$, so the inverse is $g(x) = \frac{x}{3} - \frac{1}{3}$, which is equivalent to $g(x) = \frac{x - 1}{3}$.

When the inverse of a function $f$ is a function itself, it is often denoted by $f^{-1}$. We have seen the $^{-1}$ to denote an inverse when we work with inverse trigonometric ratios. In the example above, we would write $f(x) = x + 1$ and $f^{-1}(x) = x - 1$.

The inverse of a quadratic function is a square root relation. It is important to remember the $\pm$ sign to indicate both the positive and negative square root.


Find the inverses of the following functions using any two of the above methods. Which of the inverses are also functions?

1. $f(x) = \frac{3x}{2} - 3$

2. $f(x) = \frac{1}{x + 3}$

3. $f(x) = 3(-x)^2$

### Properties of Function Inverses

If $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$, then:

* $f$ is the inverse of $f^{-1}$.
* the domain of $f$ is the range of $f^{-1}$.
* the range of $f$ is the range of $f^{-1}$.
* $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$.
* $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$.
