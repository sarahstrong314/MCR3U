Arithmetic Sequences
-------


An **arithmetic sequence** is a sequence in which each pair of consecutive terms have the same difference. This **common difference** is denoted by the constant d. The first term in an arithmetic sequence is denoted by the constant a.

For example, the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ... is an arithmetic sequence where a = 1 and d = 2.

An arithmetic sequence in function notation is t(n) = a + d(n - 1).

An arithmetic sequence represented as a recursive formula is t(1) = a, t(n) = t(n-1) + d, n â‰¤ 1.
