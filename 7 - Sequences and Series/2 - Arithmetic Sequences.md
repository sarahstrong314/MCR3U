Arithmetic Sequences
-------


An **arithmetic sequence** is a sequence in which each pair of consecutive terms have the same difference. This **common difference** is denoted by the constant $d$. The first term in an arithmetic sequence is denoted by the constant $a$, which is equivalent to $t_1$.

For example, the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ... is an arithmetic sequence where $a = 1$ and $d = 2$.

An arithmetic sequence in function notation is $t(n) = a + d(n - 1)$.

An arithmetic sequence represented as a recursive formula is $t(1) = a$, $t(n) = t(n-1) + d$, $n \ge 1$.


Write each of the following arithmetic sequences both in function notation and as a recursive formula.

1. 4, 54, 104, 154, 204, ... 

2. 5, 2, -1, -4, -7, ...
