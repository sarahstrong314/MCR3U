Arithmetic Sequences
-------


An **arithmetic sequence** is a sequence in which each pair of consecutive terms have the same difference. This **common difference** is denoted by the constant $d$. The first term in an arithmetic sequence is denoted by the constant $a$, which is equivalent to $t_1$.

Example: What are $a$ and $d$ in the arithmetic sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...?
The initial term is 1 and the terms increases by 2 each time, so $a = 1$ and $d = 2$.

Example: What are $a$ and $d$ in the arithmetic sequence 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, ...?
The initial term is 9 and the terms decreases by 2 each time, so $a = 9$ and $d = -2$.

Arithmetic sequences are discrete linear functions.

Investigation: How can an arithmetic sequence be written in function notation and as a recursive formula?

An arithmetic sequence in function notation is $t(n) = a + d(n - 1)$.

An arithmetic sequence represented as a recursive formula is $t(1) = a$, $t(n) = t(n-1) + d$, $n \ge 1$.


Write each of the following arithmetic sequences both in function notation and as a recursive formula.

1. 4, 54, 104, 154, 204, ... 

2. 5, 2, -1, -4, -7, ...
