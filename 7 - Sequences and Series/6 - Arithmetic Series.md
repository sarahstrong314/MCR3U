Arithmetic Series
-------

The series of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is S_n = \frac{n(a+t(n))}{2}.

To make sense of this formula, consider having to add the first 100 natural numbers.

We want to find 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 98 + 99 + 100.

Write it out twice, once forwards and once backwards, to get this:

1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 98 + 99 + 100

100 + 99 + 98 + ... + 3 + 2 + 1

If we add up both rows, we get twice the sum we want.

We can find that sum easily by adding each column rather than each row. 

Each column adds up to 101, and there are 100 rows so the total sum is 10100. However, we counted each number twice, so we have to divide by 2 to get 5050.

This gave us S_100 = \frac{100(1+100)}{2}.
