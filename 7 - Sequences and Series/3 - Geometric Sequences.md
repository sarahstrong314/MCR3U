Geometric Sequences
-------

A **geometric sequence** is a sequence in which each pair of consecutive terms have the same ratio. The quotient of the **ratio** is denoted by the constant r. The first term in a geometric sequence is also denoted by the constant a.

For example, the sequence 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, ... is a geometric sequence where a = 1 and r = 3.

A geometric sequence in function notation is t(n) = ar^{n - 1}.

A geometric sequence represented as a recursive formula is t(1) = a, t(n) = rt(n-1), n \ge 1.
