Geometric Sequences
-------

A **geometric sequence** is a sequence in which each pair of consecutive terms have the same ratio. The quotient of the **ratio** is denoted by the constant $r$. The first term in a geometric sequence is also denoted by the constant $a$.

For example, the sequence 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, ... is a geometric sequence where $a = 1$ and $r = 3$.

Geometric sequences are discrete exponential functions.

Investigation: How can a geometric sequence be written in function notation and as a recursive formula?

A geometric sequence in function notation is $t(n) = ar^{n - 1}$.

A geometric sequence represented as a recursive formula is $t(1) = a$, $t(n) = rt(n-1)$, $n \ge 1$.


Write each of the following geometric sequences both in function notation and as a recursive formula.

1. 8, 12, 18, 27, 40.5, ... 

2. 999, 333, 111, 37, $\frac{37}{3}$, ...


Identify each of the following sequences as arithmetic, geometric, or neither.

1. $t(n) = 3(2^n)$

2. $t(n) = 4^n + 2n$

3. $t(n) = 5 - \frac{n}{6}$
