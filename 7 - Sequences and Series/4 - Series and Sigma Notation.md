Series and Sigma Notation
-------

### Series

A **series** is a sum of the terms in a sequence.

The series of the first $n$ terms of a sequence is denoted by $S_n$.


### Sigma Notation

$\Sigma$ is the Greek letter capital sigma, which is similar to the English letter "S". It is a symbol used to express a series. To the left of the Sigma is the expression for each term. Below (or to the bottom-left of) the Sigma is the variable in the expression equated to its initial value. Above (or to the upper-left of) the Sigma is the value of the variable to stop at. Each increment is assumed to be 1. 

Example: Write the series $\sum_{n = 1}^5 {2n}$ explicitely.
The series is $2(1) + 2(2) + 2(3) + 2(4) + 2(5)$ which is $2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10$.


Example: Write the series $\sum_{n = 4}^7 {n^2 + 1}$ explicitely.
The series is $(4^2 + 1) + (5^2 + 1) + (6^2 + 1) + (7^2 + 1)$, which is $17 + 26 + 37 + 50$.


Write out each of the following series explicitely as a sum of integers.

1. $\sum_{n = -1}^3 {2n + 3}$.
 
2. $\sum_{n = -2}^2 {n^2 - 1}$.
