Series and Sigma Notation
-------

### Series

A **series** is a sum of the terms in a sequence.

The series of the first $n$ terms of a sequence is denoted by $S_n$.


### Sigma Notation

$\Sigma$ is the Greek letter capital sigma, which is similar to the English letter "S". It is a symbol used to express a series.

Here is an example of a series written in Sigma notation.

$\sum_{n=1}^5 {2n}$ is $2(1) + 2(2) + 2(3) + 2(4) + 2(5) = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10$.

$2n$ is the expression for each term. The $n = 1$ under the Sigma denotes which value of $n$ to start with, and the 5 above the Sigma denotes which value of $n$ to stop at.

Here is another example of a series written in Sigma notation.

$\sum_{n=4}^7 {n^2 + 1}$ is $(4^2 + 1) + (5^2 + 1) + (6^2 + 1) + (7^2 + 1) = 17 + 26 + 37 + 50$.
