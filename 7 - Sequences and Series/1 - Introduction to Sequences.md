Introduction to Sequences
-------

A **sequence** is an ordered list of values, called **terms**.


### Arithmetic Sequences

An **arithmetic sequence** is a sequence in which each pair of consecutive terms have the same difference. This **common difference** is denoted by the constant d. The first term in an arithmetic sequence is denoted by the constant a.

For example, the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ... is an arithmetic sequence where a = 1 and d = 2.


### Geometric Sequences

A **geometric sequence** is a sequence in which each pair of consecutive terms have the same ratio. The quotient of the **ratio** is denoted by the constant r. The first term in a geometric sequence is also denoted by the constant a.

For example, the sequence 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, ... is a geometric sequence where a = 1 and r = 3.


### Sequences Represented with Function Notation

Sequences in function notation are often denoted with the t instead of f.

The variable n is conventionally used instead of x to express that the independent variable, the term, is a natural number.

An arithmetic sequence in function notation is t(n) = a + d(n - 1).

A geometric sequence in function notation is t(n) = ar^(n - 1).

Sometimes, t_n used instead of t(n), where the t in t_n just means the nth term. t_1 is equivalent to a.


### Sequences Represented as Recursive Formulae

To represent a sequence with recursive formula, we need the initial term(s) and an general expression for the other terms based on its previous term(s).

An arithmetic sequence represented as a recursive formula is t(1) = a, t(n) = t(n-1) + d, n ≤ 1.

A geometric sequence represented as a recursive formula is t(1) = a, t(n) = rt(n-1), n ≤ 1.
