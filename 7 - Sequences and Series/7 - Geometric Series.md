Geometric Series
-------

The series of the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence is $S_n = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{(1-r)}$.

This formula is not as easy to derive as the one for arithmetic series.


Find the sum of the first 10 terms of each of the following geometric series.

1. $8 + 12 + 18 + 27 + 40.5 + ... $.

2. $999 + 333 + 111 + 37 + \frac{37}{3} + ...$.
