Geometric Series
-------

The series of the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence is $S_n = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{(1-r)}$.

Here is how the formula is derived.

Subtracting the following two identities gives $S_n - rS_n = t_1 - t_1r^n$.
$S_n = t_1 + t_1r + t_1r^2 + ... + t_1r^{n-1}$
$r \times S_n = t_1r + t_1r^2 + ... + t_1r^{n-1}  + t_1r^n$

$S_n$ can be solved for by rearranging $S_n - rS_n = t_1 - t_1r^n$ like this:

$S_n - rS_n = t_1 - t_1r^n$
$(1-r)S_n = t_1 - t_1r^n$
$S_n = \frac{t_1 - t_1r^n}{1-r}$

Find the sum of the first 10 terms of each of the following geometric series.

1. $8 + 12 + 18 + 27 + 40.5 + ... $.

2. $999 + 333 + 111 + 37 + \frac{37}{3} + ...$.
