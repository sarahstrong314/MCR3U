Multiplying and Adding Radical Expressions

### Multiplying Radical Expressions

To multiply two radicals, we use the property \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}.

For example \sqrt{20} \times \sqrt{10} = \sqrt{200} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{25} \times sqrt{2} = 2 \times 5 \times \sqrt{2} = 10\sqrt{2}


### Adding Radical Expressions

To add two radicals, we cannot apply a similar property as multiplication \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} \ne \sqrt{a + b}. However, if the integers under the roots are the same, we can add them combining their coefficients.

For example, \sqrt{5} + 2\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}.
