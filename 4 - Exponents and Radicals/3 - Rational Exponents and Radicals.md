Rational Exponents and Radicals
-------

### Reciprocal Exponents

A **radical** is an expression that uses the root symbol: √. The expression under the √ symbol is called a **radicand**. The word "radical" comes from the Latin word for root, *radix*.

We will be using one of the previous identities to determine the exponents of radicals.

Recall the Power of Powers rule: (a^n)^m = a^(nm).

Let sqrt(a) = a^n. Since (sqrt(a))^2 = a^1, we can write (a^n)^2 = a^(2n) = a^1. By the Power of Powers rule, 2n = 1, giving n = 1/2. This tells us that sqrt(a) = a^(1/2).

Now let cuberoot(a) = a^n. Since (cuberoot(a))^3 = a^1, we can write (a^n)^3 = a^(3n) = a^1. By the Power of Powers rule, 3n = 1, giving n = 1/3. This tells us that cuberoot(a) = a^(1/3).

a^(1/n) is the nth root of a. So a^(1/2) is the squareroot of a, a^(1/5) is the fifth root of a, and so on.


### Rational Exponents

When we have a rational exponent, such as a^(n/m), we can express it in these two ways.

a^(n/m) = a^(1/m)^n = (m√a)^n
a^(n/m) = a^(n)^(1/m) = m√(a^n)

a^(n/m) is the mth root of a^n, and also the nth power of the mth root of a.


### Distribution Rules of Radicals

We know that a^n × b^n = (ab)^n. We proved that this works when n is a natural number. It also works when n is a rational number, as long as a and b are not both negative.

If n = 1/2, we get sqrt(a) × \sqrt(b) = \sqrt(ab).
