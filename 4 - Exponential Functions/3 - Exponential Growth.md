Exponential Growth
-------

**Exponential Growth** is a pattern of growth in which each term is multiplied by a constant amount (greater than one) to produce the next term.

Example: Is the sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 growing exponentially?

Yes, since each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.

Many applications of exponential growth involve functions that are in the form $f(x) = a(b)^\frac{x}{k}$, where $a$ is the initial amount, $b$ is the growth rate, and $k$ is the growth amount of that rate. Both $a$ and $k$ will be positive and $b$ will be greater than 1.

The previous example can be modelled with the function $f(x) = 3(2)^x$, since the initial amount was 3, and it is growing by a factor of 2 every term.

To solve problems involving predicting how much something grows after a period of time, all we have to do is model it as a function and plug in the desired value for the independent variable.

A common application of exponential growth is bacteria population. Different bacteria grow exponentially by different factors. If there are 100 of a certain kind of bacteria that triples every two minutes, its growth can be modelled with the function $f(x) = 100(3)^\frac{x}{2}$, where $x$ is the number of minutes.

1. A type of bacteria grows so that it quadruples in number every day. A sample has an initial population of 50. What will the population of the sample be after 1 month?

2. A small town has a population of 2000. If it has a constant growth rate of 8% per year, what will its population be after 10 years?


Investigation: Collect data that can be modelled as an exponential function from secondary sources (e.g., websites such as Statistics Canada, E-STAT), and graph the data. 


1. Collect data and graph the cooling curve representing the relationship between temperature and time for hot water cooling in a porcelain mug. Predict the shape of the cooling curve when hot water cools in an insulated mug. Test your prediction. 

2. Using data from Statistics Canada, investigate to determine if there was a period of time over which the increase in Canada's national debt could be modelled using an exponential function.

3. The temperature of a cooling liquid over time can be modelled by the exponential function $T(x) = 60 \frac{1}{2}^{\frac{x}{30}}[1/2] + 20$, where $T(x)$ is the temperature, in degrees Celsius, and $x$ is the elapsed time, in minutes. Graph the function and determine how long it takes for the temperature to reach 28 degrees Celsius.
