Exponential Growth
-------

**Exponential Growth** is a pattern of growth in which each term is multiplied by a constant amount (greater than one) to produce the next term.

For example, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 is growing exponentially.

Many applications of exponential growth involve functions that are in the form $f(x) = a(b)^\frac{x}{k}$, where $a$ is the initial amount, $b$ is the growth rate, and $k$ is the growth amount of that rate. Both $a$ and $k$ will be positive and $b$ will be greater than 1.

The previous example can be modelled with the function $f(x) = 3(2)^x$, since the initial amount was 3, and it is growing by a factor of 2 every term.

To solve problems involving predicting how much something grows after a period of time, all we have to do is model it as a function and plug in the desired value for the independent variable.

A common application of exponential growth is bacteria population. Different bacteria grow exponentially by different factors. If there are 100 of a certain kind of bacteria that triples every two minutes, its growth can be modelled with the function $f(x) = 100(3)^\frac{x}{2}$, where $x$ is the number of minutes.
