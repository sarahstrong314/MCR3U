Introduction to Exponential Functions
-------

### Examples of Exponential Functions

Here are examples of **exponential functions**.

f(x) = 2^x

f(x) = -3^x - 8

f(x) = 0.5^{x - 5}

f(x) = 2*4^{x + 3} + 3

All exponential functions have the independent variable occurring only once in an exponent.


### Properties of Exponential Functions

The **base** of an exponential function is the base to the exponent the variable is in. 

For example, the base of 2^x is 2, and the base of -3^x - 8 is 3. In this course, we will be dealing with only positive bases.

All exponential functions have a **horizontal asymptote**, which is a horizontal line that the function approaches, but does not cross. This asymptote exists because 0 = b^x does not have a solution for any value of b.

All exponential functions also have only one y-intercept.


### Solving Exponential Equations

We know how to evaluate expressions with exponents, but what about solving for variables in the exponent? For example, how would we find the value of x in 256 = 2^x? 

If x happens to be an integer or a rational number, we can simply write both sides using the same base. We can solve the previous example by getting a common base of 2. We continuously dividing 256 by 2 until we get 1, and counting how many times it takes. It took 8 times, so 256 = 2^8. Then we can write 2^8 = 2^x, which means x = 8.

Here is another example: 3 = 81^x. This time, we can get a common base of 3. We divide 81 by 3 over and over again until we get 1, and counting how many times it takes. It took 4 times, so 81 = 3^4. Then we have 3 = (3^4)^x = 3^{4x}. We equate the exponents to get 1 = 4x, so x = \frac{1}{4}.

If we cannot get a common base, we can use the **logarithm** function to calculate the exact amount. To solve for a = b^x, we calculate x = \frac{log(a)}{log(b)} using the log button on a calculator. The logarithm function is the inverse of the exponential function, and will be covered in more detail in *Advanced Functions*.

* Radioactivity


### Inverses of Exponential Functions

The inverse of an exponential function is called a **logarithmic function**. The exponential function y = 2^x has the solution x = log_2y. Logarithmic functions are not covered in the course, but are covered in *Advanced Functions*.
