Exponential Decay
-------

**Exponential Decay** is a pattern of decay in which each term is multiplied by a constant fraction between zero and one to produce the next term.


Example: Is the sequence 48, 24, 12, 6, 3 decaying exponentially?

Yes, since the pattern is that each term is being divided by 2.

Many applications of exponential decay involve functions that are in the form $f(x) = a(b)^\frac{x}{k}$, where $a$ is the initial amount, $b$ is the decay rate, and $k$ is the decay amount of that rate. Both $a$ and $k$ will be positive and $b$ will be between 0 and 1.

The previous example can be modelled with the function $f(x) = 48\frac{1}{2})^x$, since the initial amount was 48, and it is decaying by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ every term.

To solve problems involving predicting how much something decays after a period of time, all we have to do is model it as a function and plug in the desired value for the independent variable.

A common application of exponential decay is decaying chemical elements. Unstable chemical elements have what is called a **half-life**, the amount of time it takes for half of it to decay. If there is 100 mg of a certain chemical element with a half-life of 50 years, its decay can be modelled with the function $f(x) = 100(\frac{1}{2})^\frac{x}{50}$.


1. Plutonium-239 has a half-life of 24 years. How long will it take a 40 mg sample of Pu-239 to decay to 5% of its original amount?

2. Titanium-44 has a half-life of 63 years. How long will it take a 100 mg sample of Ti-44 to decay to 25% of its original amount?
