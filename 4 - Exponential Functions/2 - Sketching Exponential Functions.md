Sketching Exponential Functions
-------

Recall that all exponential functions have the independent variable occurring only once in an exponent. 

The parent exponential functions are in the form $f(x) = b^x$, where $b$ is a positive base. They can be transformed to be $f(x) = a(b)^{k(x - h)} + c$, which is equivalent to $f(x) = a(b^k)^{x - h} + c$.

The $f(x) = b^x$ has a $y$-intercept of $(0, b)$, and the horizontal asymptote $x = 0$.

All transformations also have only $y$-intercept at $(0, a(b)^{-h} + c)$, and a horizontal asymptote at $x = c$.

To sketch an exponential function, we need a few points, and the location of the horizontal asymptote. It is a good rule of thumb to choose three x coordinates to plug in that are not too close together. For example, $x = -10$, $x = 0$, and $x = 10$ would be a good choice. All we have to do is connect those three points on a curve, from the farthest to the asymptote to the closest, and continue the curve closer and closer to the asymptote without crossing it.

We can also check the values of a and b to ensure that the function is...
* increasing if $a > 0$ and $b > 1$.
* increasing if $a < 0$ and $0 < b < 1$.
* decreasing if $a > 0$ and $0 < b < 1$.
* decreasing if $a < 0$ and $b > 1$.


Sketch the following exponential functions. State their domains and ranges.

1. $f(x) = -(2)^{4x)} + 3$

2. $f(x) = 4(3)^{x - 1)}$


Without sketching the following exponential functions, determiene whether they are increasing or decreasing functions.

1. $f(x) = -(4)^{x - 3)}$

2. $f(x) = -(2)^{-(x - 4)}$


Investigation: Determine, using Desmos, that the equation of a given exponential function can be expressed using different bases [e.g., $f(x) = 9^x$ can be expressed as $f(x) = 3^{2x}$]. Explain the connections between the equivalent forms by comparing graphs, using transformations, using the exponent laws.

Investigation: Determine and describe key properties relating to domain and range, intercepts, increasing/decreasing intervals, and asymptotes for exponential functions represented in a variety of ways [e.g., tables of values, mapping diagrams, graphs, equations, function machines].

Investigation:  Determine using Desmos the roles of the parameters $a$, $k$, $d$, and $c$ in functions of the form $y = af (k(x – d)) + c$, and describe these roles in terms of transformations on the graph of $f(x) = a^x$, $a > 0$, $ a \ne 1$. (i.e., translations; reflections in the axes; vertical and horizontal stretches and compressions to and from the x- and y-axes).


1. Graph $f(x) = 2^x$, $g(x) = 3^x$ and $h(x) = 0.5^x$ on the same set of axes. Make comparisons between the graphs, and explain the relationship between the $y$-intercepts. 

2. Transform the graph of $f(x) = 3^x$ to sketch $g(x) = 3^{–(x + 1)} – 2$, and state the domain and range of each function

3. Investigate the graph of $f(x) = 3(x – d) – 5$ for various values of $d$, using Desmos, and describe the effects of changing $d$ in terms of a transformation.
