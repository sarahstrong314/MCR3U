Sketching Exponential Functions
-------

Recall that all exponential functions have the independent variable occurring only once in an exponent. 

The parent exponential functions are in the form $f(x) = b^x$, where $b$ is a positive base. They can be transformed to be $f(x) = a(b)^{k(x - h)} + c$, which is equivalent to $f(x) = a(b^k)^{x - h} + c$.

The $f(x) = b^x$ has a $y$-intercept of $(0, b)$, and the horizontal asymptote $x = 0$.

All transformations also have only $y$-intercept at $(0, a(b)^{-h} + c)$, and a horizontal asymptote at $x = c$.

To sketch an exponential function, we need a few points, and the location of the horizontal asymptote. It is a good rule of thumb to choose three x coordinates to plug in that are not too close together. For example, $x = -10$, $x = 0$, and $x = 10$ would be a good choice. All we have to do is connect those three points on a curve, from the farthest to the asymptote to the closest, and continue the curve closer and closer to the asymptote without crossing it.

We can also check the values of a and b to ensure that the function is...
* increasing if $a > 0$ and $b > 1$.
* increasing if $a < 0$ and $0 < b < 1$.
* decreasing if $a > 0$ and $0 < b < 1$.
* decreasing if $a < 0$ and $b > 1$.
