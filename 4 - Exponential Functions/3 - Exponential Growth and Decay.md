Exponential Growth and Decay
-------


### Exponential Growth

**Exponential Growth** is a pattern of growth in which each term is multiplied by a constant amount (greater than one) to produce the next term.

For example, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 is growing exponentially.

Many applications of exponential growth involve functions that are in the form f(x) = a(b)^(x/k), where a is the initial amount, b is the growth rate, and k is the growth amount of that rate. Both a and k will be positive and b will be greater than 1.

The previous example can be modelled with the function f(x) = 3(2)^x, since the initial amount was 3, and it is growing by a factor of 2 every term.

To solve problems involving predicting how much something grows after a period of time, all we have to do is model it as a function and plug in the desired value for the independent variable.

A common application of exponential growth is bacteria population. Different bacteria grow exponentially by different factors. If there are 100 of a certain kind of bacteria that triples every two minutes, its growth can be modelled with the function f(x) = 100(3)^(x/2), where x is the number of minutes.


### Exponential Decay

**Exponential Decay** is a pattern of decay in which each term is multiplied by a constant fraction between zero and one to produce the next term.

For example, 48, 24, 12, 6, 3 is decaying exponentially.

Many applications of exponential decay involve functions that are in the form f(x) = a(b)^(x/k), where a is the initial amount, b is the decay rate, and k is the decay amount of that rate. Both a and k will be positive and b will be between 0 and 1.

The previous example can be modelled with the function f(x) = 48(1/2)^x, since the initial amount was 48, and it is decaying by a factor of 1/2 every term.

To solve problems involving predicting how much something decays after a period of time, all we have to do is model it as a function and plug in the desired value for the independent variable.

A common application of exponential decay is decaying chemical elements. Unstable chemical elements have what is called a **half-life**, the amount of time it takes for half of it to decay. If there is 100 mg of a certain chemical element with a half-life of 50 years, its decay can be modelled with the function f(x) = 100(1/2)^(x/50).
