Introduction to Exponential Functions
-------

### Examples of Exponential Functions

Here are examples of **exponential functions**.

f(x) = 2^x

f(x) = -3^x - 8

f(x) = 0.5^(x - 5)

f(x) = 2*4^(x + 3) + 3

All exponential functions have the independent variable occurring only once in an exponent.


### Properties of Exponential Functions

The **base** of an exponential function is the base to the exponent the variable is in. 

For example, the base of 2^x is 2, and the base of -3^x - 8 is 3. In this course, we will be dealing with only positive bases.

All exponential functions have a **horizontal asymptote**, which is a horizontal line that the function approaches, but does not cross. This asymptote exists because 0 = b^x does not have a solution for any value of b.

All exponential functions also have only one y-intercept.
