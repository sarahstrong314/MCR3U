Introduction to Polynomial Functions
-------

Here are examples of **polynomial functions**.

f(x) = 5

f(x) = x - 6

f(x) = 2x^2 + x + 4

f(x) = x^3 + 2x - 4

f(x) = 4x^4 + x^2 + 2

f(x) = 3x^10 - x^7 + 2x^2 - 9

**Linear functions** and **quadratic functions** are all examples of polynomial functions.


Polynomial function can also be written in factored form when all their roots are real.

These are also examples of polynomial functions, since you can expand them into polynomials.

f(x) = (x - 4)(3x + 4)

f(x) = 3(x - 2)(x - 4)(x + 2)

f(x) = -(x - 1)(2x + 1)(x + 3)^2
