Introduction to Trigonometric Functions
-------

### Trigonometric Ratios

Recall the three primary trigonometric ratios: sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan).

There are also the reciprocal trigonometric ratios: cosecant (csc), secant (sec), and cotangent (cot).

sin(x) = 1/csc(x), cos(x) = 1/sec(x), and tan(x) = 1/cot(x).

For each of these six ratios, we also have inverses: sin^-1, cos^-1, tan^-1, csc^-1, sec^-1, and tan^-1.

Trigonometric functions are functions using these twelve ratios, but in this course we will be working with only the first six.


### Examples of Trigonometric Functions

Here are examples of **trigonometric functions**.

f(x) = sin(x)

f(x) = -sin(x + 30)

f(x) = tan(2x - 60)

f(x) = csc(-x + 90)

In this course, the independent variable x will be measured in degrees.


### Properties of Sinusoidal Functions

**Sinusoidal** functions are functions that use the sine and cosine ratios.

Unlike polynomial or exponential functions, sinusoidal functions are **periodic functions**, meaning they have a repeating pattern. After a certain horizontal distance, called the **period**, the function will repeat itself. 

Sinusoidal functions also have infinitely many maxima and minima. The **amplitude** is half the distance between the maximum value and minimum value.
