Inverse of Functions
-------

The **inverse of a function** is the resulting function when the independent variable and dependent variable are swapped.

For example, the inverse of f(x) = x + 1 is f^-1(x) = x - 1. The ^-1 is often used to denote the inverse of a function when the inverse is a function itself.

To graph an inverse of a function, first graph the function, then reflect it over the line y = x.


### Inverses of Polynomial Functions

The inverse of a linear function is another linear function.

The inverse of a quadratic function is a square root relation.

The inverse of a cubic function is a cube root relation.

The inverse of any polynomial function is a radical relation, which uses the root symbol: âˆš. It will also use the \pm sign.


### Inverses of Exponential Functions

The inverse of an exponential function is called a **logarithmic function**. The exponential function y = 2^x has the solution x = log_2y. Logarithmic functions are not covered in the course, but are covered in *Advanced Functions*.


### Inverses of Trigonometric Functions

The inverse of a trigonometric function uses the trigonometric ratio's inverse ratio. For example, the inverse of a sine funcion is the sine inverse (i.e. arcsin) function, and the inverse of a sine inverse function is the sine function.
