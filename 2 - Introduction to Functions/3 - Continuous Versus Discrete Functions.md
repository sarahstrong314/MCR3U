Continuous vs. Discrete Functions
-------

### 

- discrete vs. continuous
- define domain and range 
- describe the domain and range of a function appropriately 
- determine the domain and range of numeric, graphical, and algebraic representations of the functions f(x) = x, f(x) = x2, f(x) = âˆšx, and f(x) = 1/x
- explain any restrictions on domain and range in contexts arising from real-world applications
