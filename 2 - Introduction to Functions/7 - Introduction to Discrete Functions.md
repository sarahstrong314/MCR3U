Introduction to Discrete Functions
-------

### Continuous and Discrete Functions

A **continuous function** is a function whose domain is a continuous range of real numbers. All continuous functions can be graphed and traced without lifting up the pencil.

Polynomial, exponential, and sinusoidal functions are all examples of continuous functions.

A **discrete function** is a function that can be written explicitly as a finite number of ordered pairs. All discrete functions can be graphed by drawing a dot for each coordinate.

Some types of discrete functions are not often graphed. For examples, the Fibonacci Sequence is an example of a discrete function, and it is often simply written as a list of values: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ... In this case, the independent variable is the term number, and the dependent variable is the value.

Another example of a sequence is 1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, ... which is the factorial function. The factorial function, denoted by an exclamation mark, is defined as n! = n(n-1)(n-2)...(2)(1) where n \in \mathbb{Z}, n ≤ 0. In other words, the factorial of an integer greater than or equal to 0 is that number multiplied by every other positive integer less than it. 2! = 2 × 1 = 2, 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6, and 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. The factorial function is a discrete function since the domain is only natural numbers and 0.


### Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences

A **sequence** is an infinite ordered list of numbers. A sequence is an example of a discrete function.

In this course, we will be focussing on two categories of sequences: arithmetic and geometric sequences.

An **arithmetic sequence** is a sequence in which each pair of consecutive terms have the same difference. 

For example, the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ... is an arithmetic sequence. The common difference is 2.

A **geometric sequence** is a sequence in which each pair of consecutive terms have the same ratio. 

For example, the sequence 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, ... is a geometric sequence. The ratio is 1:3, or simply 3.


### Discrete Functions and Finances

Savings accounts at banks have **interest rates**, which increases the amount you have in your account at regular intervals. The amount of money in account over time can be represented as a continuous function with time as the independent variable, or as a discrete function with the number of intervals as the independent variable.

Interest rates also come up when loaning money. Often, services that offer a loan charge an interest rate. The more money you borrow, the more you have to pay back.

There are two kinds of interest that we will be covering in this course: **simple interest** and **compound interest**. They represent different kinds of growth.
