Vertical and Horizontal Shifts
-------

### Vertical Shifts

A **vertical shift** is a transformation resulting from a constant being added to a function. 

This constant is denoted c. When c is positive, it is an upwards shift. When c is negative, it is a downwards shift.
 
Examples: The transformation of f(x) = x^2 + 3 is a vertical shift of 3 upwards, the transformation of f(x) = x^2 - 3 is a vertical shift of 3 downwards.
 
 
### Horizontal Shifts

A **horizontal shift** is a transformation resulting from the independent variable being replaced by itself minus a constant. 

This constant is denoted h. When h is positive, it is a shift to the right. When h is negative, it is a shift to the left.

Examples: The transformation of f(x) = (x - 3)^2 is a horizontal shift of 3 to the right, the transformation of f(x) = (x + 3)^2 is a horizontal shift of 3 to the left.
