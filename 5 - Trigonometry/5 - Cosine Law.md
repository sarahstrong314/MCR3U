Cosine Law
-------

Not every triangle can be solved using the Sine Law. When we have two sides and the angle between them, or we have three sides, we need another means.

Consider the following triangle.

The Cosine Law is the following: a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bccosA. We can also rearrange it to get cosA = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}.

The Cosine Law works on every triangle, however it is best used for cases in which the Sine Law doesn't work.

If we use the Cosine Law on a right triangle, we get the Pythagorean Theorem.
