Trigonometric Identities

### Pythagorean Identity

Since the unit circle has the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1, substituting (sinθ, cosθ) gives us a useful identity: sin^2θ + cos^2θ = 1 for all values of θ. sin^2θ is the conventional way to write (sinθ)^2, and same goes for cos^2θ. This is called a **Pythagorean Identity** since the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1 creating the unit circle is a result of the Pythagorean Theorem.


### Reciprocal Identitites

Recall the reciprocal trigonometric ratios: cosecant (csc), secant (sec), and cotangent (cot).

The reciprocal identities are the following: sin(θ) = 1/csc(θ), cos(θ) = 1/sec(θ), and tan(θ) = 1/cot(θ).

It may help to remember that the reciprocal of a ratio starting with "co" does not start with "co".


### Quotient Identity

If we substitute sinθ = OPP/HYP and cosθ = ADJ/HYP from SOHCAHTOA into sinθ/cosθ, we get sinθ/cosθ = (OPP/HYP)/(ADJ/HYP) = (OPP/HYP) × (HYP/ADJ) = OPP/ADJ = tanθ. This gives us the quotient identity sinθ/cosθ = tanθ.
