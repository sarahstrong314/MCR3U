Sine Law
-------

When we are solving for missing sides or angles in right triangles, we can always use SOHCAHTOA or the Pythagorean Theorem. However, we cannot use them the triangle is not a right triangle.

Consider the following triangle.

[TODO: image of triangle with sides and angles labelled]

The Sine Law is the following: $\frac{sinA}{a} = \frac{sinB}{b} = \frac{sinC}{c}$. We can also take the reciprocals to get the equivalent: $\frac{a}{sinA} = \frac{b}{sinB} = \frac{c}{sinC}$. The triangle is intentionally labelled in this manner so that the pattern in the Sine Law is clear.

We can use the Sine Law to solve for missing sides or angles in triangles when we have 2 sides and an angle, or two angles and a side, the angle given must be opposite to one of the sides given. 

If we use the Sine Law on right triangles, we get SOHCAHTOA.


### The Ambiguous Case

Ambiguous means "open to one or more interpretations". This is sometimes the case when we have two sides and angle.

Consider the two images below.

[TODO: images showing ambiguous case]

In both cases, $a = 4$, $c =  6$, and $\angle A = 30^\circ$. However, they are different triangles.

If we use the Sine Law, we get $\frac{sinA}{a} = \frac{sinC}{c} \Rightarrow \frac{sin30^\circ}{4} = \frac{sinC}{6} \Rightarrow \frac{6(\frac{1}{2})}{4} = sinC \Rightarrow sinC = \frac{3}{4} \Rightarrow C = sin^{-1}(\frac{3}{4}) \Rightarrow C \approx 49^\circ$.

This is the answer to the acute triangle, since your calculator will give the solution between $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$. To find the answer to the obtuse triangle, we have to determine another solution to $C = sin^{-1}(\frac{3}{4})$. We know that the sine ratio is positive in $Q1$ and $Q2$, so the solution is somewhere between $90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$. Since $49^\circ$ is the related angle, we get $180^\circ - 49^\circ = 131^\circ$. We could also have just looked at the image and observed that they are supplementary angles.

The ambiguous case occurs when the triangle is not a right triangle and the angle given is not opposite of the longest of the two given sides.
