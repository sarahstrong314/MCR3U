What is a Polynomial?
-------

## Definitions:
* A **constant** is a fixed value. Constants can sometimes be denoted by a letter when the value is unknown or difficult to write.
Examples of constants: 1000, -29, 1/2, 4.19374, pi, sqrt(2), -25/3, the speed of light, the number of atoms in the universe
* A **variable** is a nonfixed value, often denoted by a letter near the end of the alphabet.
Examples of variables: x, y, z.
* A **term** is an algebraic expression that is a product of constants and variables. 
Examples of terms: 9, x, 2x, -7xy, x/2, x^3
Nonexamples of terms: 1/x, sqrt(x), x^3.5
* A **polynomial** is a sum of terms.
Examples of polynomials: 3x + x^2, 8 + xy + y^2 + x^2y
* A **reduced polynomial** is a polynomial that cannot be simplified.
Examples of reduced polynomials: 3x + x^2, 2 + y + x
Nonexamples of reduced polynomials: 2x + 8x, -x^2 + x + 3x^2
* The **degree of a term** is the sum of the exponents to which the variables are raised.
Examples: The degree of 2x^3 is 3, the degree of -x is 1, the degree of 4x^2y^3 is 5
* The **leading term** in a reduced polynomial is the term with the highest degree.
Examples: The leading term of 7x^3 + 6x + x^4 is x^4
* The **degree of a polynomial** is the degree of its leading term.
Examples: The degree of 7x^3 + 6x + x^4 is 4
