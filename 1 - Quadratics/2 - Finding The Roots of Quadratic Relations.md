Finding The Roots of Quadratic Relations
-------

### Standard Form vs. Factored Form
A quadratic relation is in **standard form** if it is in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, for some constants a ≠ 0, b, and c.

A quadratic relation is in **factored form** if it is in the form y = a(x-s)(x-t), for some constants a ≠ 0, s, and t. 


### The Roots of a Quadratic Relation
The **root of a quadratic relation** are the values of the independent variable when the dependent variable is 0. 

To find the roots of a quadratic relation, we need to solve for the independent variable when the dependent variable is 0.


### Finding the Roots of a Quadratic Relation in Factored Form
When a quadratic relation is in factored form, y = a(x-s)(x-t), the roots are s and t. This is because if you plug in x=s, you get a(0)(s-t) = 0, and if you plug in x=t, you get a(t-s)(0)=0.


### Finding the Roots of a Quadratic Relation in Standard Form
When a quadratic relation is in standard form, you can try to rewrite it in factored form to solve for the roots. However, not all quadratic relations can be easily factored, and some may not be factorable at all.

You can also use **the quadratic formula**, which is a fool-proof way of finding the roots.

The quadratic formula is x = \frac{- b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}. To find the roots of any quadratic relation, all you have to do is plug in the values of a, b, and c from the standard form.

The \pm indicates that one root is determined by using a +, and the other root is determined by using a -.


### Real Roots vs. Nonreal Roots
The b^2 - 4ac part of the quadratic formula is called the **discriminant**, and it gives us information about the roots.

A **real root** is a root that is a real number. 

If the discriminant is positive, we get two real roots.

If the discriminant is 0, we get only one real root, since \frac{-b + \sqrt{0}}{2a} gives the same result as \frac{-b - \sqrt{0}}{2a}.

If the discriminant is negative, we get zero real roots, since the squareroot of a negative real number is not a real number. The quadratic relation still has roots, but they are **nonreal roots**, called complex numbers. Complex numbers cannot be graphed on a Cartesian Plane, so these roots will not be the x-intercepts.
