Families of Quadratic Relations
-------

A **family of quadratic relations** is the set of quadratic relations that share a common characteristic. Characteristic include a common point, the same two roots.

For example, the family of quadratic relations with the roots (0, 1) and (0, -2) can be represented with the equation y = a(x - 1)(x + 2), where a is a constant. The family of quadratic relations with the vertex (1, 2) can be represented with the equation y = a(x - 1)^2 + 1.

To represent a family of quadratic relations with a single equation, we need to have a symbol (often the letter a) represent a constant. Although the symbol varies, it is considered to be constant rather than a variable since it represents a constant in each individual quadratic relation in the family.
