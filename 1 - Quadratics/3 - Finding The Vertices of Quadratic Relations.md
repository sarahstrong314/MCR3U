Finding the Vertices of Quadratic Relations
-------

### Maxima vs. Minima

All quadratic relations have either a maximum or minimum value. It has a minimum value if its *a* value in standard form or factored form is positive, and if has a maximum value if *a* is negative.

Since a parabola has vertical symmetry, the axis of symmetry goes through the vertex. 


### Vertex Form

A quadratic relation is in vertex form if it is in the form y = a(x-h)^2 + k. The vertex is (h, k).


### Completing The Square

To rewrite a quadratic relation from standard form to vertex form, we perform a process called **completing the square**. 

A quadratic is a **perfect square** if it can be written as a(x-s)^2. In other words, perfect squares are in the form ax^2 + 2asx + as^2. 

Completing the square involves taking a binomial of the form and finding what other term has to be added in order to get a perfect square.

For example, if we have x^2 + 6x, we can add 9 to get a perfect square since x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2. All we have to do is half the second term, then square it.


### Finding the Roots of a Quadratic Relation in Standard or Factored Form

Since we can easily find the vertex of a quadratic relation in vertex form, all we have to do is rewrite a quadratic relation in vertex form.

Here is an example of how to rewrite a quadratic relation in vertex form from standard form.

y = x^2 + 6x + 5

y = (x^2 + 6x + 9 - 9) + 5

y = (x^2 + 6x + 9) - 9 + 5

y = (x + 3)^2 - 4

This tells us that the vertex of x^2 + 6x + 5 is (-3, -4).

Here is another example.

y = 2x^2 - 4x + 5

y = 2(x^2 - 2x) + 5

y = 2(x^2 - 2x + 1 - 1) + 5

y = 2(x^2 - 2x + 1) - 2 + 5

y = 2(x - 2)^2 + 4

This tells us that the vertex of 2x^2 - 4x + 5 is (2, 1).


To rewrite a quadratic relation in vertex form from factored form, rewrite it in standard form first by expanding it.
