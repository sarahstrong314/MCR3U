Quadratic Relations
-------

### Definition

* A **quadratic relation** is an equation in which the left side is a dependent variable and the right side is equivalent to a polynomial of degree 2 with one independent variable.

These are all examples of quadratic relations.

y = x^2

y = 3x^2 + 1

y = -x^2 + x - 4

y = (x + 2)(x - 4)

d = 4.9t^2 + 7t - 5

These are all nonexamples of quadratic relations.

y = x^3 + x^2 

y = 1/x^2

y = x^2 + xz

y = x^2 + x + 1/x


A quadratic is in **standard form** when it is in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c.

When quadratic relations are represented in a table of values, the second difference is a constant. When the x-values are incrementing by 1, the second difference is the same as the *a* value in standard form.

Here is an example of a quadratic relation represented as a table of values. The second difference is 2.

| x | y |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | -4 |
| 1 | -1 |
| 2 | 6 |
| 3 | 17 |

When quadratic relations are graphed on a Cartesian plane, the shape it makes is called a **parabola**.


### Key features of Parabolas 
* All parabolas either open up, or open down. It opens up when *a* is positive, and opens down when *a* is negative.
* The **y-intercept** is the coordinates on a parabola that lie on the y-axis. All parabolas have exactly one y-intercept.
* The **roots** (also known as **zeroes**) are coordinates on the parabola that lie on the x-axis. All parabolas have either zero, one, or two roots. 
* The **vertex** of a parabola is the extreme point. The y-value of this vertex is a **minimum value** when *a* is positive, and a **maximum value** when *a* is negative. 
* The **axis of symmetry** is the vertical line of symmetry of the parabola. The equation for the axis of symmetry is in the form x = h, where *h* is the x-coordinate of the vertex, or the average x-coordinate of the roots.
