Simple Interest and Linear Growth
-------

### Definitions

* A **principal**, *P*, is an amount of money initially invested or borrowed.
* An **annual rate of interest**, *r*, is a rate at which interest is charged, as a percent, per year. It is a value between 0 and 1. The word *annual* comes from the Latin word for year, annum.
* An **amount**, *A*, is a value of an investment or loan at the end of a time period. 
* **Interest**, *I*, is money paid regularly at a particular rate for the use of money lent, or for delaying the repayment of a debt.
* **Simple interest** is interest calculated only on the original principal, as opposed to the current amount.


### Formulae

Simple interest after t years can be calculated using I = P \times r \times t.

The amount can be calculated using A = P + I. The formula for I can be substituted to get A = P(1 + rt)

These formulae can be applied only when money is deposited or lent on only one occasion. If money is constantly being deposited or lent, we are not dealing with simple interest. 

If the rate of interest is not annual (i.e. per annum), we can still use the formula I = P \times r \times t, however the unit for *t* needs to match the rate *r*. For example, if the rate of interest is semi-annual (i.e., every 6 months), t would be the number of 6 month intervals that have passed.


### Growth of Simple Interest

Looking at the formula for simple interest, we can see that it is a linear relation. This means that when you deposit money into an account using a simple interest plan and leave it, your money will grows in a linear fashion.

Depending on how often the rate is applied, it might not always be growing. Often, the interest is applied after every year, which would resemble a **linear step function** rather than a linear function.
