Annuities
-------

### Definitions

* **Regular payments** are payments of equal value made at equal time periods.
* **Regular withdrawals** are withdrawals of equal value at equal time periods.
* An **annuity** is a sum of money paid as a series of regular payments.
* An **ordinary annuity** is an annuity for which the payments are made at the end of each payment period.
* A **simple annuity** is an annuity for which the compounding and payment periods are the same.
* A **present value of an annuity**, *PV*, is the amount of money needed to finance a series of regular withdrawals
* A **future value**, *FV*, is the amount that an annuity will grow to, with given interest and time conditions.


### Formulae

The amount, A, of an annuity can be calculated using A = R((1 + i)^n - 1)/i, where R is the regular payment, i is the interest rate per compounding period, and n is the number of compounding periods.

The present value, PV, of an annuity can be calculated using PV = R(1 - (1 + i)^(-n))/i. 

These formulae can be applied only when annuities are involved. If money is deposited or lent on only one occasion, we are not dealing with annuities
