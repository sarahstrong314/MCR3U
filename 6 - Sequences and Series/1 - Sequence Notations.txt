Sequence Notation

### Sequences Represented with Function Notation

Sequences in function notation are often denoted with the t instead of f.

The variable n is conventionally used instead of x to express that the independent variable, the term, is a natural number.

An arithmetic sequence in function notation is t(n) = a + d(n - 1).

A geometric sequence in function notation is t(n) = ar^(n - 1).

Sometimes, t_n used instead of t(n), where the t in t_n just means the nth term. t_1 is equivalent to a.


### Sequences Represented as Recursive Formulae

To represent a sequence with recursive formula, we need the initial term(s) and an general expression for the other terms based on its previous term(s).

An arithmetic sequence represented as a recursive formula is t(1) = a, t(n) = t(n-1) + d, n \ge 1.

A geometric sequence represented as a recursive formula is t(1) = a, t(n) = rt(n-1), n \ge 1.
