Rational Exponents and Radicals
-------

### Reciprocal Exponents

A **radical** is an expression that uses the root symbol: $\sqrt{}$. The expression under the $\sqrt{}$ symbol is called a **radicand**. The word "radical" comes from the Latin word for root, *radix*.

We will be using one of the previous identities to determine the exponents of radical expressions.


Recall the Power of Powers rule: $(a^n)^m = a^{nm}$.

Let $\sqrt{a} = a^n$. Since $(\sqrt{a})^2 = a^1$, we can write $(a^n)^2 = a^{2n} = a^1$. By the Power of Powers rule, $2n = 1$, giving $n = \frac{1}{2}$. This tells us that $\sqrt{a} = a^\frac{1}{2}$.

Now let $\sqrt[3]{a} = a^n$. Since $(\sqrt[3]{a})^3 = a^1$, we can write $(a^n)^3 = a^{3n} = a^1$. By the Power of Powers rule, $3n = 1$, giving $n = \frac{1}{3}$. This tells us that $\sqrt[3]{a} = a^\frac{1}{3}$.

$a^\frac{1}{n}$ is the $n$th root of $a$. So $a^\frac{1}{2}$ is the squareroot of $a$, $a^\frac{1}{5}$ is the fifth root of $a$, and so on.

### Rational Exponents

Investigation: Determine the value of a power with a rational exponent.

When we have a rational exponent, such as $a^\frac{n}{m}$, we can express it in these two ways.

$a^\frac{n}{m} = a^{\frac{1}{m}^n} = \sqrt[m]{a}^n$.
$a^\frac{n}{m} = a^{n^\frac{1}{m}} = \sqrt[m]{a^n}$.

$a^\frac{n}{m}$ is the $m$th root of $a^n$, and also the $n$th power of the $m$th root of $a$.

### Distribution Rules of Radicals

Investigation: Verify that $\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}$ when $a \ge 0$ and $b \ge 0$. 

We know that $a^n \times b^n = (ab)^n$. We proved that this works when $n$ is a natural number. It also works when $n$ is a rational number, as long as $a$ and $b$ are not both negative.

If $n = \frac{1}{2}$, we get $\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}$.
