Negative Exponents and Reciprocals

### Negative Exponents

Recall the Product of Powers rule: a^n \times a^m = a^(m + n).

Let 1/a = a^n. Since (1/a)*a = 1, we can write (a^n) \times a^1 = a^(n+1) = a^0 = 1. By the product rule, n + 1 = 0, giving n = -1. 

This gives us the Negative Power rule: 1/a = a^-1.

We can use this to prove the Negative Power of Quotient rule: (a/b)^-1 = b/a.

(a/b)^-1 = 1/(a/b) = 1*(b/a) = b/a
