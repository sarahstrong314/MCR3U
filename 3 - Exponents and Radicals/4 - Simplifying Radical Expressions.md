Simplifying Radical Expressions
-------

Recall that \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}. We will be using this property a lot when simplifying radicals.

A radical expression is simplified when the radicand is an integer that does not have any square factors greater than 1.

For example, \sqrt{40} can be reduced to \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{10} = 2\sqrt{10}, whereas \sqrt{30} cannot be reduced further.

To know for sure whether a radical can be simplified, we can check all of the square factors less than or equal to radicand.

For example, to check whether \sqrt{30} can be simplified, we check whether 4, 9, 16, or 25 (the square numbers less than 30) divide 30. None of them do, so \sqrt{30} cannot be simplified.

Here is another example:

\sqrt{224} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{56} = 2\sqrt{56}. However, we're not done since 4 is a factor of 56. 2\sqrt{56} = 2 \times \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{14} = 4\sqrt{14}. Since 14 doesn't have any square factors greater than 1, we're done.

When the radicand is a fraction, we can use the property
\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}. This comes from the Power of Quotients rule.

Simplifying radical expressions that are fractions will be cover later on this unit.
