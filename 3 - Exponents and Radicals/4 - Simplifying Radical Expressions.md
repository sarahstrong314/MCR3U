Simplifying Radical Expressions
-------

Recall that $\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}$. We will be using this property a lot when simplifying radicals.

A radical expression is simplified when the radicand is an integer that does not have any square factors greater than 1.

Example: Simplify $\sqrt{40}$.

$\sqrt{40} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{10} = 2\sqrt{10}$.

Example: Simplify $\sqrt{224}$.

$\sqrt{224} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{56} = 2\sqrt{56}$. However, we are not done since 4 is a factor of 56. $2\sqrt{56} = 2 \times \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{14} = 4\sqrt{14}$. Since 14 does not have any square factors greater than 1, we are done.

To know for sure whether a radical can be simplified, we can check all of the square factors less than or equal to the radicand.

Example: Simplify $\sqrt{30}$.

Since all the perfect squares less than 30 (1, 4, 9, 16, 25) do not divide 30 other than 1, 30 does not have a perfect square as a factor. This means that $\sqrt{30}$ cannot be simplified further.


When the radicand is a fraction, we can use the property
$\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}$. This comes from the Power of Quotients rule.

Simplifying radical expressions that are fractions will be cover later on this unit.
