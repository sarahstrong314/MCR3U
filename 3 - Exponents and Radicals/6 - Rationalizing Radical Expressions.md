### Rationalizing Radical Expressions

When we have a fraction with a radical expression in the denominator, it is not considered simplified. The process of eliminating a radical in a denominator is called **rationalizing**. 

In order to rationalize, we need to multiply both the numerator and denominator by a radical so that the denominator becomes an integer.

For example, $\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{9}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3 \times \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}} = \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2}$.

When we have a fraction where the denominator is a sum or difference of an integer and a radical, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the **conjugate**. The conjugate of $a + \sqrt{b}$ is $a - \sqrt{b}$, and vice versa. This will allow the denominator to become an integer.

For example, $\frac{5}{3 +\sqrt{2}} = \frac{5 \times (3 + \sqrt{2})}{(3 + \sqrt{2}) \times (3 + \sqrt{2})} = \frac{15 + 5\sqrt{2}}{9 + 2} = \frac{15 + 5\sqrt{2}}{11}$.


Rationalize each of the following radical expressions.

1. $\frac{4}{\sqrt{2}}$

2. $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + 1}$
