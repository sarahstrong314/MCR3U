Multiplying, Adding, and Subtracting Radical Expressions
-------

### Multiplying Radical Expressions

To multiply two radicals, we use the property \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}.

For example \sqrt{20} \times \sqrt{10} = \sqrt{200} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{25} \times sqrt{2} = 2 \times 5 \times \sqrt{2} = 10\sqrt{2}.

We can also use the property c\sqrt{a} \times d\sqrt{b} = cd\sqrt{ab}.

For example, 3\sqrt{2} \times 4\sqrt{3} = 12\sqrt{6}.

To multiply two radical expressions that involve both integers and radicals, we use the distribution rule just like when expanding polynomials.


### Adding and Subtracting Radical Expressions

To add two radicals, we cannot apply a similar property as multiplication \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} \ne \sqrt{a + b}. However, if the radicands are the same, we can add them by simply adding their coefficients.

For example, 3\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{5} = 4\sqrt{5}.

To subtract to radicals with the same radicand, we simply subtract their coefficients.

For example, 3\sqrt{5} - \sqrt{5} = 2\sqrt{5}.
