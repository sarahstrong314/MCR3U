Multiplying, Adding, and Subtracting Radical Expressions

### Multiplying Radical Expressions

To multiply two radicals, we use the property $\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}$ and simplify the result.

Example: Multiply $\sqrt{20}$ and $\sqrt{10}$.

$\sqrt{20} \times \sqrt{10} = \sqrt{200} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{2} = 2 \times 5 \times \sqrt{2} = 10\sqrt{2}$.

We can also use the property $c\sqrt{a} \times d\sqrt{b} = cd\sqrt{ab}$.

Example: Multiply $3\sqrt{2}$ and $4\sqrt{3}$.

$3\sqrt{2} \times 4\sqrt{3} = 12\sqrt{6}$.

To multiply two radical expressions that involve both integers and radicals, we use the distribution rule just like when expanding polynomials.


Rewrite each of the following expressions as a single radical and simplify.

1. $\sqrt{8} \times \sqrt{3}$

2. $(2 + \sqrt{5}) \times \sqrt{3}$


### Adding and Subtracting Radical Expressions

To add two radicals, we cannot apply a similar property as multiplication $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} \ne \sqrt{a + b}$. However, if the radicands are the same, we can add them by simply adding their coefficients. To subtract to radicals with the same radicand, we simply subtract their coefficients.

Example: find the sum and difference of $3\sqrt{5}$ and $\sqrt{5}.
$3\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{5} = 4\sqrt{5}$.  
$3\sqrt{5} - \sqrt{5} = 2\sqrt{5}$.


Rewrite each of the following expressions as a single radical and simplify.

1. $3\sqrt{8} + \sqrt{8}$

2. $\sqrt{5} - \sqrt{20}$
