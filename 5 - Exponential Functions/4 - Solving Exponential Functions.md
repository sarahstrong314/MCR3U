Solving Exponential Functions
-------

We know how to evaluate expressions with exponents, but what about solving for variables in the exponent. For example, how would we find the value of x in 256 = 2^x? 

If x happens to be an integer or a rational number, we can simply write both sides using the same base. We can solve the previous example by getting a common base of 2. We continuously dividing 256 by 2 until we get 1, and counting how many times it takes. It took 8 times, so 256 = 2^8. Then we can write 2^8 = 2^x, which means x = 8.

Here is another example: 3 = 81^x. This time, we can get a common base of 3. We divide 81 by 3 over and over again until we get 1, and counting how many times it takes. It took 4 times, so 81 = 3^4. Then we have 3 = (3^4)^x = 3^(4x). We equate the exponents to get 1 = 4x, so x = 1/4.

If we cannot get a common base, we can use the **logarithm** function to calculate the exact amount. To solve for a = b^x, we calculate x = log(a)/log(b) using the log button on a calculator. The logarithm function is the inverse of the exponential function, and will be covered in more detail in *Advanced Functions*.
