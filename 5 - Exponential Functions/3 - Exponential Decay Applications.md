Exponential Decay Applications
-------

**Exponential Decay** is a pattern of decay in which each term is multiplied by a constant fraction between zero and one to produce the next term.

For example, 48, 24, 12, 6, 3 is decaying exponentially.

Many applications of exponential decay involve functions that are in the form f(x) = a(b)^(x/k), where a is the initial amount, b is the decay rate, and k is the decay amount of that rate. Both a and k will be positive and b will be between 0 and 1.

The previous example can be modelled with the function f(x) = 48(1/2)^x, since the initial amount was 48, and it is decaying by a factor of 1/2 every term.

To solve problems involving predicting how much something decays after a period of time, all we have to do is write it as a function and plug in the desired value for the independent variable.

A common application of exponential decay is decaying chemical elements. Some chemical elements have what is called a **half-life**, the amount of time it takes for half of it to decay. If there is 100 mg of a certain chemical element with a half-life of 50 years, its decay can be modelled with the function f(x) = 100(1/2)^(x/50).
