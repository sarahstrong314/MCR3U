Terms
-------

### Definitions
* A **constant** is a fixed value. Constants can sometimes be denoted by a letter when the value is unknown or difficult to write.

 Examples of constants: 1000, -29, 1/2, 4.19374, pi, sqrt(2), -25/3, the speed of light, the number of atoms in the universe

* A **variable** is a nonfixed value, often denoted by a letter near the end of the alphabet.

 Examples of variables: x, y, z

* A **term** is an algebraic expression that is a product of constants and variables. A constant in front of a variable is called a *coefficient*.

 Examples of terms: 9, x, 2x, -7xy, x/2, x^3
 Nonexamples of terms: 1/x, sqrt(x), x^3.5

* The **degree of a term** is the sum of the exponents to which the variables are raised.

 Examples: The degree of 2x^3 is 3, the degree of -x is 1, the degree of 4x^2y^3 is 5
 
* Two or more terms are **like terms** if they contain the same variables with the same degrees. 

 Examples of like terms: -4 and 5, x and 2x, -7xy^2 and -4xy^2, x^3 and 3x^3
 Nonexamples of terms: x and x^2, 2 and x, x^2 and x^3  


### Understanding Terms 
Recall that a term is a product of constants and variables. For example, 8x^2 is a term because 8x^2 = 8 \times x \times x.

Here is a table showing the different parts of some terms.

| | Coefficient | Variables | Degree of each variable | Degree of term | Expanded form of term |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | N/A| N/A | N/A | 0 | 2 |
| x | 1 | x | 1 | 1 | x |
| 2x | 2 | x | 1 | 1 | 2 \times x  |
| x^2 | 1 | x | 2 | 2 | x \times x |
| 2x^2 | 2 | x | 2 | 2 | 2 \times x \times x |
| 2xy | 2 | x, y | 1, 1 | 2 | 2 \times x \times y |
| 2x^2y | 2 | x, y| 2, 1 | 3 | 2 \times x \times x \times y |
