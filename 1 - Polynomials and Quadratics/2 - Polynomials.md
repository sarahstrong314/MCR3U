Polynomials
-------

### Definitions
* A **polynomial** is a sum of terms.

 Examples of polynomials: 3x + x^2, 8 + xy + y^2 + x^2y, 3 + x + 7 + x^2 + 2x

* A **reduced polynomial** is a polynomial that cannot be simplified.

 Examples of reduced polynomials: 3x + x^2, 2 + y + x
 
 Nonexamples of reduced polynomials: 2x + 8x, -x^2 + x + 3x^2

* The **leading term** in a reduced polynomial is the term with the highest degree.

 Example: x^4 is the leading term of 7x^3 + 6x + x^4

* The **degree of a polynomial** is the degree of its leading term.

 Example: 4 is the degree of 7x^3 + 6x + x^4

 
### Understanding Polynomials
Recall that a polynomial is a sum of terms. For example, 1 + 2x + x^2 is a polynomial because 1, 2x, and x^2 are all terms.  1 - 2x + x^2 is also a polynomial because it is the sum of 1, -2x, and x^2, which are all terms.

Here is a table showing the different parts of some polynomials.

| | Constants | Coefficients | Variables | Terms | Like terms | Simplified form |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 + x | 2 | 1 | x | 2, x | N/A | 2 + x |
| -x + y | N/A | -1, 1 | x, y | -x, y| N/A | -x + y |
| 2x - x^2 + y | N/A | 2, -1, 1  | x, y | 2x,  -x^2, y | N/A | 2x - x^2 + y |
| -3 + x + y^2 + 2x | -3 |  1, 1, 2 | x, y | -3, 3x, y^2 | x, 2x | -3 + 3x + y^2 |


### Types of Polynomials

The word "polynomial" comes from two Greek words: "polys" (many) and "nomos" (part). The "parts" in this case are the terms.

There are different names for polynomials with a certain number of terms.

* A **monomial** is a reduced polynomial with *one* term.

* A **binomial** is a reduced polynomial with *two* terms.

* A **trinomial** is a reduced polynomial with *three* terms.


"Monos" means single in Greek, "bis" means twice in Latin, and "tres" means three in Latin.
