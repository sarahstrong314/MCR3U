Sketching Quadratic Relations

### Finding Important Points of a Quadratic
To sketch a linear relation, we need at least two points, but to sketch a quadratic relation, we need at least three points. To sketch as accurately as possible, we should find the vertex, the roots, and the y-intercept. If there are no roots, we can find some other points by substituting convenient values of x.

To find the y-intercept, we simply substitute x = 0 into the quadratic equation.

To find the roots, we factor the quadratic equation. If it is not factorable, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots or determine that there are none.

To find the vertex, we can substitute the average x-coordinates of the roots. If there are no roots, we can rewrite the quadratic relation into vertex form to find the vertex.

Once we have enough important points, all we do is plot them then connect them to create a parabola.
