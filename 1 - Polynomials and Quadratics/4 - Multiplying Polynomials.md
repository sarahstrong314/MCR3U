How Do We Multiply Polynomials?
-------

### Multiplying Terms
Recall that a term is a product of constants and variables. To multiply two terms, we multiply the constants and variables they're made up of.
For example, to multiple 3x and 4x^2, we simplify 3 × x × 4 × x × x to get 12x^3. In other words, all we have to do is multiply the coefficients and add the degrees for each variable.

Here is another example. -3x^2y × 2x^3y^2 = -6x^5y^3


### Multiplying Polynomials
To multiply a monomial by a polynomial, multiply the monomial by each term in the polynomial, then add them all together. For example, to multiply 3x and -7 + 2x - x^2, we simplify 3x(-7) + 3x(2x) + 3x(-x^2) to get -21x + 6x^2 - 3x^3.

To multiply a binomial by a polynomial, multiply the first term in the binomial by the polynomial, then multiply the second term in the binomial by the polynomial, then add them all together. For example, to multiply 2 + 3x and -7 + 2x - x^2, we add 2(-7) + 2(2x) + 2(-x^2) and 3x(-7) + 3x(2x) + 3x(-x^2) to get -14 + 4x + -2x^2 + -21x + 6x^2 - 3x^4, then simplify to get -14 - 17x + 5x^2 - 3x^3.

In general, to multiply two polynomials, we multiply each term in the first polynomial by the second polynomial, then add them all together. In this course, the most complex case will have to deal with is multiplying a binomial by a polynomial.
