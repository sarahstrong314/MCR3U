Quadratic Relations
-------

### Definition
* A **quadratic relation** is an equation in which the left side is a dependent variable and the right side is a polynomial of degree 2 with one independent variable.

These are all examples of quadratic relations.

y = x^2

y = 3x^2 + 1

y = -x^2 + x - 4

d = 4.9t^2 + 7t - 5

These are all nonexamples of quadratic relations.

y = x^3 + x^2 

y = 1/x^2

y = x^2 + xz

y = x^2 + x + 1/x

When quadratic relations are represented in a table of values, the second difference is a constant.

Here is an example of a quadratic relation represented as a table of values. The second difference is 2.

| x | y |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | -4 |
| 1 | -1 |
| 2 | 6 |
| 3 | 17 |

When quadratic relations are graphed on a Cartesian plane, the shape it makes is called a **parabola**.


### Key features of Parabolas 
* The **y-intercept** is the coordinates on a parabola that lie on the y-axis. All parabolas have exactly one y-intercept.
* The **roots** (also known as **zeroes**) are coordinates on the parabola that lie on the x-axis. All parabolas have either zero, one, or two roots. 
* The **vertex** of a parabola is the extreme point. If the leading coefficient of the quadratic is positive, it is a minimum value, and if the leading coefficient is negative, it is a maximum value.. 
* All parabolas have either a **maximum value** or **minimum value**. It is the y-coordinate of the vertex.
* The **axis of symmetry** is the vertical line of symmetry of the parabola. The equation for the axis of symmetry is in the form x = a, where a is the x-coordinate of the vertex.
