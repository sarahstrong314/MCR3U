Grade 10 Review: 
Investigating the Basic Properties of Quadratic Relations
– collect data that can be represented as a quadratic relation, from experiments or from secondary sources; graph the data and draw a curve of best fit, if appropriate, with or without the use of technology
– determine, through investigation with and without the use of technology, that a quadratic relation of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c (a \ne 0) can be graphically represented as a parabola, and that the table of values yields a constant second difference 
– identify the key features of a graph of a parabola (i.e., the equation of the axis of symmetry, the coordinates of the vertex, the y-intercept, the zeros, and the maximum or minimum value), and use the appropriate terminology to describe them
