Quadratic Equations Review
-------

##Definitions:
* A **quadratic polynomial** is a polynomial with one variable whose degree is 2.
* A **quadratic relation** is an equation in which the left side is a single variable and the right side is a quadratic polynomial using a different variable.

These are all examples of quadratic relations.

y = x^2
y = 3x^2 + 1
y = -x^2 + x - 4
d = 4.9t^2 + 7t - 5

These are all nonexamples of quadratic relations.

y = x^3 + x^2 
y = 1/x^2
y = x^2 + x + 1/x

When quadratic relations are graphed on a Cartesian plane, the shape it makes is called a **parabola**.

When quadratic relations are represented in a table of values, the second difference is a constant.
