Quadratic Equations Review
-------

##Definitions:
* A **term** is an algebraic expression consisting of
* A **polynomial** is a sum of terms.
* The **degree of a term** is the exponent to which the variable is raised.
* The **leading term** in a polynomial is the term with the highest degree.
* The **degree of a polynomial** is the degree of its leading term.
* A **quadratic equation** is a polynomial whose degree is 2.

These are all examples of quadratic relations.

y = x^2
y = 3x^2 + 1
y = -x^2 + x - 4

These are all nonexamples of quadratic relations.

y = x^3 + x^2 
y = 1/x^2

When quadratic relations are graphed on a Cartesian plane, the shape it makes is called a **parabola**.



Grade 10 Review: 
Investigating the Basic Properties of Quadratic Relations
– collect data that can be represented as a quadratic relation, from experiments or from secondary sources; graph the data and draw a curve of best fit, if appropriate, with or without the use of technology
– determine, through investigation with and without the use of technology, that a quadratic relation of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c (a \ne 0) can be graphically represented as a parabola, and that the table of values yields a constant second difference 
– identify the key features of a graph of a parabola (i.e., the equation of the axis of symmetry, the coordinates of the vertex, the y-intercept, the zeros, and the maximum or minimum value), and use the appropriate terminology to describe them
