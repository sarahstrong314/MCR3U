Applications of Sinusoidal Functions
-------

Although the independent variable for the sine and cosine functions are measured in degrees, sinusoidal functions can also be used to model problems not involving angles.

Sinusoidal functions can model problems involving circulating around a point. For example, the relationship between the height above the ground of a person riding a Ferris wheel and time can be modelled using a sinusoidal function. There are several factors that effect this function, such as: the height of the platform, the radius of the Ferris Wheen, and the speed of the Ferris wheel.


The following functions model the height in metres of different Ferris wheels after $t$ seconds. Determine each of their maximum and minumum heights, and the time it takes to complete one revolution.

1. $h(t) = 10sin(3(t - 30)) + 12$

2. $h(t) = 8cos(2(t - 30)) + 20$

3. $h(t) = 14sin(4t)) + 10$
