Applications of Sinusoidal Functions
-------

Although the independent variable for the sine and cosine functions are measured in degrees, sinusoidal functions can also be used to model problems not involving angles.

Sinusoidal functions can model problems involving circulating around a point. For example, the relationship between the height above the ground of a person riding a Ferris wheel and time can be modelled using a sinusoidal function. 

Investigation: Determine the effects to the following factors have on a function modeling the motion of a Ferris Wheel: the height of the platform, the radius of the Ferris Wheen, and the speed of the Ferris wheel.

Investigation: Using Desmos, explain how the function $h(t) = 5sin(30(t + 3))$ approximately models the relationship between the height and the time of day for a tide with an amplitude of 5m, if high tide is at midnight.

Investigation: Collect data that can be modelled as a sinusoidal function from secondary sources (e.g., websites such as Statistics Canada, E-STAT), and graph the data. Are there any restrictions on the domain?


The following functions model the height, in metres, of different Ferris wheels after $t$ seconds. Determine each of their maximum and minumum heights, and the time it takes to complete one revolution.

1. $h(t) = 10sin(3(t - 30)) + 12$

2. $h(t) = 8cos(2(t - 30)) + 20$

3. $h(t) = 14sin(4t)) + 10$


The following functions model the deptth, in metres, of tides in different locations at $t$ hours after midnight. Determine what the high and low tides are and when they occur. 

1. d(t) = 3.7sin(60(t - 120) + 5.2

2. d(t) = 2.9sin(60(t + 90)) + 5.8
