Solving Sinusoidal Equations
-------

Recall that there are exactly two solutions to sinθ = x, where 0° ≤ θ < 360° and -1 ≤ x ≤ 1. Same goes for solutions to cosθ = x.

Since the sine function have a period of 360°, if sinθ = x then sin(θ + k360°) = x, for all k \in \mathbb{Z}. Same goes for the cosine function.

When we're solving a sinusoidal function for a value of θ, there are infinitely solutions when the domain is not restricted, but we can express the set of all solutions.

For example, the solution to sinθ = 1/2, 0° ≤ θ < 360°, is θ = 30° or θ = 150°. To express the set of all solutions to sinθ = 1/2, we can write θ = 30° + k360°, k \in \mathbb{Z} or θ = 150° + k360°, k \in \mathbb{Z}.
