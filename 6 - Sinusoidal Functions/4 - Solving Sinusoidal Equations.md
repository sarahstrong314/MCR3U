Solving Sinusoidal Equations
-------

Recall that there are exactly two solutions to $sin\theta= x$, when $0\degree \le \theta < 360\degree$ and $-1 \le x \le 1$. Same goes for solutions to $cos\theta = x$.

Since the sine function has a period of $360\degree$, if $sin\theta = x$ then $sin(\theta+ k360\degree) = x$, for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. Same goes for the cosine function.

When we are solving a sinusoidal function for a value of $\theta$, there are infinitely solutions when the domain is not restricted, but we can express the set of all solutions.

For example, the solution to $sin\theta = \frac{1}{2}$, $0\degree \le \theta< 360\degree$, is $\theta = 30\degree$ or $\theta= 150\degree$. To express the set of all solutions to $sin\theta = \frac{1}{2}$, we can write $\theta = 30\degree + k360\degree$, $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ or $\theta = 150\degree + k360\degree$, $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
