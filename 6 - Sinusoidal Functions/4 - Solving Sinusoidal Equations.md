Solving Sinusoidal Equations
-------

Recall that there are exactly two solutions to $sin\theta = x$, when $0^\circ \le \theta < 360^\circ$ and $-1 \le x \le 1$. Same goes for solutions to $cos\theta = x$.

Since the sine function has a period of $360^\circ$, if $sin\theta = x$ then $sin(\theta+ k360^\circ) = x$, for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. Same goes for the cosine function.

When we are solving a sinusoidal function for a value of $\theta$, there are infinitely solutions when the domain is not restricted, but we can express the set of all solutions.

To express all the multiples of 360, we can write ${x = 360k | k \in \mathbb{Z}}$, which is equivalent to ${... -720, -360, 0, 360, 720, ...}$. To express all the integers that are a multiple away of 360 from 30, we can write ${x = 30 + 360k | k \in \mathbb{Z}}$, which is equivalent to ${... -690, -330, 30, 390, 750, ...}$. We can use this idea to express solution sets to sinusoidal equations. To combine two sets, we can use the symbol $\cup$, pronounded "union".

Example: Express the solution set to $sin\theta = \frac{1}{2}$.
When $0^\circ \le \theta< 360^\circ$, the solutions are $\theta = 30^\circ$ and $\theta = 150^\circ$. Without the restriction on the domain, every solution is a multiple of $360^\circ$ away from either $30^\circ$ or $150^\circ$. Therefore, the solutions set is ${\theta = 30^\circ + k360^\circ | $k \in \mathbb{Z}} \cup {\theta = 150^\circ + k360^\circ$ | $k \in \mathbb{Z}}$.

The example uses the domain $0^\circ \le \theta< 360^\circ$ to find two distinct solutions, however any domain that spans $360^\circ$ can be used.


State the set of all solutions to the following sinusoidal equations.

1. $sin2(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}$.

2. $sin(\theta + 1) = \frac{1}{2}$.

3. $sin(-\theta) = \frac{1}{2}$.
