The Sine Wave
-------

### The Sine Function

The sine function is the function $f(x) = sinx$. This relation is a function since $sinx$ has only one solution for any value $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

Recall the sine values of some of the special angles.

| $\theta$ | $sin\theta$ |
| --- | --- |
| $0^\circ$ | 0 |
| $30^\circ$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ |
| $60^\circ$ | $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ |
| $90^\circ$ | 1 |

Recall the following table for finding related angles.

| Quadrant of angle $\theta$ | Related angle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| $Q1$  | $\theta$ |
| $Q2$ | $180^\circ - \theta$ | 
| $Q3$ | $\theta- 180^\circ$ | 
| $Q4$ | $360^\circ - \theta$ | 

We can use this along with the CAST rule to finish the rest of the table of values using increments of $30^\circ$ up to $360^\circ$.

| $\theta$ | $sin\theta$ |
| --- | --- |
| $0^\circ$ | 0 |
| $30^\circ$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ |
| $60^\circ$ | $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ |
| $90^\circ$ | 1 |
| $120^\circ$ | $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ |
| $150^\circ$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ |
| $180^\circ$ | 0 |
| $210^\circ$ | $-\frac{1}{2}$ |
| $240^\circ$ | $-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ |
| $270^\circ$ | -1 |
| $300^\circ$ | $-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ |
| $300^\circ$ | $-\frac{1}{2}$ |
| $360^\circ$ | 0 |

By plotting these points and connecting them with a smooth curve, we see that the shape of the sine function resembles a wave. In fact, this shape is referred to as the **sine wave**.


### The Cosine Function

Going through the same procedure as for the sine function, we can come up with this table of values for the cosine function.

We can use this along with the CAST rule to finish the rest of the table of values using increments of $30^\circ$ up to $360^\circ$.

| $\theta$ | $cos\theta$ |
| --- | --- |
| $0^\circ$ | 1 |
| $30^\circ$ | $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ |
| $60^\circ$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ |
| $90^\circ$ | 0 |
| $120^\circ$ | $-\frac{1}{2}$ |
| $150^\circ$ | $-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ |
| $180^\circ$ | -1 |
| $210^\circ$ | $-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ |
| $240^\circ$ | $-\frac{1}{2}$ |
| $270^\circ$ | 0 |
| $300^\circ$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ |
| $330^\circ$ | $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ |
| $360^\circ$ | 0 |

By plotting these points and connecting them with a smooth curve, we see that it has the same shape as the sine function. We can take the graph of the sine function and translate it horizontally by $90^\circ$ to get the graph of the cosine function. Note that the the $y$-intercept of the cosine function is $(1,0)$, whereas for the sine function it was $(0,0)$.   


### Increasing and Decreasing Intervals

* An **increasing interval** of a function is a subset of the domain in which the function is *increasing*.
* A **decreasing interval** of a function is a subset of the domain in which the function is *decreasing*.

Both the sine and cosine function have infinitely many increasing and decreasing intervals.

In the function $f(\theta) = cos\theta$, $(0^\circ, 180^\circ)$ is a decreasing interval and $(180^\circ, 360^\circ)$ is an increasing interval. At the maxima and minima, the function is considered to be neither increasing not decreasing.

Since the cosine function repeats itself after every 360^\circ, all of the decreasing intervals start at a multiple of $360^\circ$ and end $180^\circ$ later. We can express all decreasing intervals as $(k360^\circ, k360^\circ + 180^\circ)$, $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. Similarly, we can express all increasing intervals as $(k360^\circ - 180^\circ, k360^\circ)$, $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Using the same process, the increasing intervals for the sine function are (k360^\circ - 90^\circ, k360^\circ + 90^\circ), k \in \mathbb{Z} and the decreasing intervals are (k360^\circ + 90^\circ, k360^\circ + 270^\circ), k \in \mathbb{Z}.

Sketch one cycle of each of following trigonometric functions. State each functions's increasing and decreasing intervals.

1. $f(x) = tanx$

2. $f(x) = cscx$

3. $f(x) = cscx$
