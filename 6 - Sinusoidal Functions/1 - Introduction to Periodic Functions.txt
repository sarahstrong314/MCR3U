Introduction to Periodic Functions
-------

**Periodic functions** are function that have a repeating pattern. After a certain horizontal distance, called the **period**, the function will repeat itself. They have infinitely many maxima and minima. The **amplitude** is half the distance between the maximum value and minimum value.


### Sinusoidal Functions

**Sinusoidal functions** are functions that use the sine and cosine ratios (not including the arcsin or arccos functions).

Unlike polynomial or exponential functions, sinusoidal functions are periodic functions. This is because $sin(x) = sin(x + 360^\circ) = sin(x + 720^\circ) = ...$ and same goes for $cos(x)$.

The **axis** of a sinusoidal function is the horizontal line to which there is rotational symmetry.
