Sketching Sinusoidal Functions
-------

### Definitions

* The **period** of a periodic function is the horizontal distance of its graph after which it repeats itself.
* A **cycle** of a periodic function is its shape for one period. There are many different cycles, depending on where you start.
* The **amplitude** of a periodic function is half the distance between the maximum value and the minimum value.
* A **phase shift** of a periodic function is the horizontal shift its base function with the vertical compression applied.


### Key Properties of Sinusoidal Functions

These are the key features of a sinusoidal function in the form f(x) = asin(k(x – d)) + c or f(x) = acos(k(x – d)) + c.

* The domain is \mathbb{R}.
* The range is [c - |a|, c + |a|].
* The amplitude is |a|.
* The phase shift is d/k.
* The period is 360°/|k|, where || denotes magnitude or absolute value.
* The maximum value is c + |a|.
* The minimum value is c - |a|.

Here is a technique to sketch a sine or cosine function in the form f(x) = asin(k(x – d)) or f(x) = acos(k(x – d)).

1. Draw the y-axis, but do not mark its intervals.
2. Determine the y-intercept and the phase shift.
3. Sketch the sine wave starting at the y-intercept with the appropriate phase shift.
4. Mark the maximum and minimum value of the wave on the y-axis.
5. Draw the x-axis according to the markings on the y-axis.
6. Determine the period and mark the x-axis accordingly.

Another technique is to simply draw the base function, apply the vertical stretch/compression, then the vertical shift, then the horizontal stretch/compression, then the horizontal shift. However, that involves a lot of erasing!
