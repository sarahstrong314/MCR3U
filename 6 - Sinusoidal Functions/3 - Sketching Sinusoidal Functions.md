Sketching Sinusoidal Functions
-------

### Definitions

* The **period** of a periodic function is the horizontal distance of its graph after which it repeats itself.
* A **cycle** of a periodic function is its shape for one period. There are many different cycles, depending on where you start.
* The **amplitude** of a periodic function is half the distance between the maximum value and the minimum value.
* A **phase shift** of a periodic function is the horizontal shift its base function with the vertical compression applied.


### Key Properties of Sinusoidal Functions

These are the key features of a sinusoidal function in the form $f(x) = asin(k(x – d)) + c$ or $f(x) = acos(k(x – d)) + c$.

* The domain is $\mathbb{R}$.
* The range is $[c - \abs{a}, c + \abs{a}]$.
* The amplitude is $\abs{a}$.
* The phase shift is $\frac{d}{k}$.
* The period is $\frac{360^\circ}{\abs{k}}$.
* The maximum value is $c + \abs{a}$.
* The minimum value is $c - \abs{a}$.

Here is a technique to sketch a sine or cosine function in the form $f(x) = asin(k(x – d))$ or $f(x) = acos(k(x – d))$.

1. Draw the $y$-axis, but do not mark its intervals.
2. Determine the $y$-intercept and the phase shift.
3. Sketch the sine wave starting at the $y$-intercept with the appropriate phase shift.
4. Mark the maximum and minimum value of the wave on the $y$-axis.
5. Draw the $x$-axis according to the markings on the $y$-axis.
6. Determine the period and mark the $x$-axis accordingly.

Another technique is to simply draw the base function, apply the vertical stretch/compression, then the vertical shift, then the horizontal stretch/compression, then the horizontal shift. However, that involves a lot of erasing!

Sketch the following trigonometric functions.

1. $f(x) = 2sin(x - 90^\circ)$

2. $f(x) = cos(-2x) + 3$
