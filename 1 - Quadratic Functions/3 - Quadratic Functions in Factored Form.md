Quadratic Functions in Factored Form
-------

A quadratic function is in **factored form** if it is in the form $f(x) = a(x - s)(x - t)$, for some constants $a \ne 0$, $s$, and $t$. The parabola opens up when $a$ is positive, and opens down when $a$ is negative.


### Finding the Roots of a Quadratic Function in Factored Form

To find the roots of a quadratic function, we need to solve for the independent variable when the dependent variable is 0.

When a quadratic function is in factored form, $f(x) = a(x - s)(x - t)$, the roots are $s$ and $t$. This is because if you plug in $x = s$, you get $a(0)(s-t) = 0$, and if you plug in $x = t$, you get $a(t-s)(0) = 0$.

All quadratic functions in factored form have one or two real roots. A **real root** is a root that is a real number (i.e. does not involve a square root of a negatve number). 


### Finding the Vertex of a Quadratic Function in Factored Form

Because a parabola is vertically symmetrical, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is half-way between the $x$-coordinates of the two roots. Once we have the roots of a quadratic function, we can also find its vertex by plugging in its $x$-coordinate into the equation. If there is one root, that root is also the vertex.


### Sketching a Quadratic Function in Factored Form

To sketch a linear function, we need at least two points, but to sketch a quadratic function, we need at least three points. To sketch as accurately as possible, we should find the vertex, the roots, and the $y$-intercept. If some of those points coincide and we do not have enough points, we can find some other points by substituting convenient values of $x$.

Once we have enough important points, all we do is plot and connect them to create a parabola.


For each of the following quadratic functions, find its roots, its vertex, its y-intercept, then sketch it.

1. $f(x) = (x - 4)(x + 3)$

2. $f(x) = 2(x + 4)(x - 3)$

3. $f(x) = -(x - 4)(x + 3)$
