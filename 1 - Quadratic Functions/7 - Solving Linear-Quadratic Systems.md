Solving Linear-Quadratic Systems
-------

Recall from grade 9 that solving a system of equations involves finding points of intersection. This is what we will be doing, except with both linear and quadratic functions.

When we graph a linear function and a quadratic function on the same plane, there are three possibilities for how they intersect. They either intersect 0 times, exactly once, or exactly twice.

Here are some examples.

f(x) = -1 and g(x) = x^2 do not intersect.

f(x) = x and g(x) = x^2 intersect exactly once at (0,0).

f(x) = x + 2 and g(x) = x^2 intersect exactly twice at (-1, 1) and (2, 4).

Since we know how to graph both linear and quadratic functions, one way to find their intersections is to graph them and find where the two functions intersect.

To find the intersections without graphing, we simply equate them and solve for the roots.

For example, to find the intersections of f(x) = x + 2 and g(x) = x^2, find the solutions to x + 2 = x^2. We get 0 = x^2 - x - 2 = (x + 1)(x - 2), so the roots are when x = -1 and x = 2. This tells us that f(x) = x + 2 and g(x) = x^2 intersect when x = -1 and x = 2. Now we plug those values into either f(x) = x + 2 or g(x) = x^2, to get the points (-1, 1) and (2, 4).
