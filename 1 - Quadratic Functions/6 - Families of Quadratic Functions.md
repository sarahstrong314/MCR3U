Families of Quadratic Functions
-------

A **family of quadratic functions** is the set of quadratic functions that share a common characteristic, such as a common point or the same two roots.

For example, the family of quadratic functions with the roots $(0, 1)$ and $(0, -2)$ can be represented with the equation $y = a(x - 1)(x + 2)$, where $a$ is a constant. The family of quadratic functions with the vertex $(1, 2)$ can be represented with the equation $y = a(x - 1)^2 + 1$.


Investigation: Determine the transformational relationship among the family of quadratic functions that have the same zeros 


Determine the equation of the family of quadratics that have the following roots, then determine which member goes through the point $(2, 5)$

1. $x = 1 \pm \sqrt{5}$.

2. $x = \frac{3 \pm 2}{2}$

To represent a family of quadratic functions with a single equation, we need to have a symbol (often the letter $a$) represent a constant. Although the symbol varies, it is considered to be constant rather than a variable since it represents a constant in each individual quadratic function in the family.


For each of the following families of quadratic functions, graph the functions for which $a = 2$, 0, and -2. Describe what the family members share in common.

1. $f(x) = 2(x - a)(x + 3)$

2. $f(x) = x^2 + ax + 2$

3. $f(x) = a(x + 2)(x + 4)$
