Families of Quadratic Functions
-------

A **family of quadratic functions** is the set of quadratic functions that share a common characteristic, such as a common point or the same two roots.

For example, the family of quadratic functions with the roots $(0, 1)$ and $(0, -2)$ can be represented with the equation $y = a(x - 1)(x + 2)$, where $a$ is a constant. The family of quadratic functions with the vertex $(1, 2)$ can be represented with the equation $y = a(x - 1)^2 + 1$.

To represent a family of quadratic functions with a single equation, we need to have a symbol (often the letter $a$) represent a constant. Although the symbol varies, it is considered to be constant rather than a variable since it represents a constant in each individual quadratic function in the family.
