Quadratic Functions
-------

### Definitions

* A **quadratic function** is a polynomial function in which the independent variable has degree 2.

These are all examples of quadratic functions.

$f(x) = x^2$

$f(x) = 3x^2 + 1$

$f(x) = -x^2 + x - 4$

$f(x) = (x + 2)(x - 4)$

$d(x) = 4.9t^2 + 7t - 5$

These are all nonexamples of quadratic relations.

$f(x) = x^3 + x^2$ 

$f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$

$f(x) = x^2 + x + \frac{1}{x}$


A quadratic is in **standard form** when it is in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$.

When quadratic functions are represented in a table of values, the second difference is a constant. When the $x$-values are incrementing by 1, the second difference is the same as the $a$ value in standard form.

Here is an example of a quadratic function represented as a table of values. The second difference is 2.

| $x$ | $f(x)$ |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | -4 |
| 1 | -1 |
| 2 | 6 |
| 3 | 17 |

When quadratic functions are graphed on a Cartesian plane, the shape it makes is called a **parabola**.

Which of the following tables of values represent quadratic functions?

1.
| $x$ | $f(x)$ |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 4 |
| 1 | 3 |
| 2 | 0 |
| 3 | -5 |
| 4 | -12 |
| 5 | -21 |

2.
| $x$ | $f(x)$ |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 7 |
| 1 | 4 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 4 |
| 4 | 7 |
| 5 | 12 |

3. $f(x) = 3x^2 + x + 0.5$

4. $f(x) = x^2 + x/2$

### Key features of Parabolas 
* All parabolas either open up, or open down. It opens up when $a$ is positive, and opens down when $a$ is negative.
* The **$y$-intercept** is the coordinates on a parabola that lie on the $y$-axis. All parabolas have exactly one $y$-intercept.
* The **roots** (also known as **zeroes**) are coordinates on the parabola that lie on the $x$-axis. All parabolas have either zero, one, or two roots. 
* The **vertex** of a parabola is the extreme point. The $y$-value of this vertex is a **minimum value** when $a$ is positive, and a **maximum value** when $a$ is negative. 
* The **axis of symmetry** is the vertical line of symmetry of the parabola. The equation for the axis of symmetry is in the form $x = h$, where $h$ is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex, or the average $x$-coordinate of the roots.
