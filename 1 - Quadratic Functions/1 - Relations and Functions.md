Relations and Functions
-------


### Definitions

* An **independent variable** is a variable that is not influenced by another variable.

* A **dependent variable** is a variable that is influenced by another variable.

* A **tuple** is an ordered list of things, called **elements**. Tuples are denoted using parentheses, where each element is separated by a comma.

* A **set** is an unordered list of things, called **elements**. Sets are denoted using curly braces, where each element is separated by a comma.

* An **ordered pair** is a tuple of two values. The first value is an independent variable and the second one is a dependent variable.

* A **relation** is a relationship between an independent and dependent variable expressed as a set of ordered pairs, a table of values, a graph, or an equation.

These are all examples of relations.

${(1,1), (1,4), (2,6), (5,2), (3,7)}$

| $x$ | $y$ |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | -1 |
| 1 | 10 |
| 2 | 8 |
| 3 | -11 |

 $y^2 = x^2 + 4$

* A **function** is a relation in which each independent variable value has only one corresponding dependent variable value.


### Functions vs. Relations

To tell whether a set of ordered pairs or a table of values is a function, check whether each x value appears only once.

${(1,1), (1,4), (2,6), (5,2), (3,7)}$ is not a function since the $x$-coordinate 1 has two corresponding $y$-coordinates: 1 and 4.

The following table of values is a function since each $x$-coordinate has only one corresponding $y$-coordinate.

| $x$ | $y$ |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | -1 |
| 1 | 10 |
| 2 | 8 |
| 3 | -11 |


To tell whether a graph of a relation is a function, use the **vertical-line test**. This involves holding a straight-edge, such as a ruler, parallel to the $y$-axis and moving it along to see whether it hits two or more points of the relation at once. If it does not, the relation is a function.
 
To tell whether an equation is a function, graph it and use the vertical-line test.


Which of the following relations are not functions? Modify the ones that are not to turn them into functions.

1. {(3, 4), (1, 5), (-2, -2), (3, 6), (2, 9), (-1, 9)}


2.
| $x$ | $y$ |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | -1 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 5 |
| 3 | -4 |
| 4 | -1 |
| 5 | 3 |


3. $2y = x^2 + 2$



### Function Notation

Every function is assigned a name when it is written in function notation. Often, it is simply named $f$, but if we need more names we often resort to $g$ and $h$. We also need to explicitly state what the independent variables are, usually $x$.

When we name a function $f$ and $x$ is the independent variable, the dependent variable is denoted by $f(x)$, pronounced "f of x". If we have more than one independent variable, such as both $x$ and $y$, we write $f(x, y)$.

Here are examples of functions written as equations.

$f(x) = x + 1$

$g(x) = x^2 + 3x - 2$

$h(x) = ax^3 - 5x$

By writing them using function notation, we can easily refer to each function without confusing them. We also know for sure that $a$ in function $h$ is a constant, because if it were another variable we would write $h(a, x)$ instead.

When we want to evaluate the function at a specific value of $x$, say 3, we can write $f(3)$ to mean the value of f evaluated at $x = 3$.
Using the three functions above, $f(3) = 4$, $g(3) = 16$, and $h(3) = 27a - 15$.

Evaluate the following, given that $f(x) = x^2 + 5$

1. $f(2)$

2. $f(-2)$

3. $f(\frac{1}{2})$

We can also substitute polynomials in place of $x$. To do this, we replace every instance of $x$ in the equation with the polynomial.
Using the three functions above, $f(x + c) = x + c + 1$, $g(x - d) = (x - d)^2 + 3(x - d) - 2$, and $h(kx) = a(kx)^2 - 5kx$. 


If $f(x) = 2x$, express the following.

1. $f(-x)$

2. $f(x + 2)$

3. $f(x^2)$
