Quadratic Functions in Standard Form
-------

A quadratic relation is in **standard form** if it is in the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, for some constants $a \ne 0$, $b$, and $c$.


### Finding the Roots of a Quadratic Relation in Standard Form

When a quadratic relation is in standard form, you can try to rewrite it in factored form to solve for the roots. However, not all quadratic functions can be easily factored, and some may not be factorable at all.

You can also use **the quadratic formula**, which is a fool-proof way of finding the roots.

The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{- b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. To find the roots of any quadratic relation, all you have to do is plug in the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ from the standard form.

The $\pm$ indicates that one root is determined by using a $+$, and the other root is determined by using a $-$.


### Real Roots vs. Nonreal Roots

The $b^2 - 4ac$ part of the quadratic formula is called the **discriminant**, and it gives us information about the roots.

If the discriminant is positive, we get two real roots.

If the discriminant is 0, we get only one real root, since $\frac{-b + \sqrt{0}}{2a}$ gives the same result as $\frac{-b - \sqrt{0}}{2a}$.

If the discriminant is negative, we get zero real roots, since the squareroot of a negative real number is not a real number. The quadratic relation still has roots, but they are **nonreal roots**, called complex numbers. Complex numbers cannot be graphed on a Cartesian Plane, so these roots will not be the $x$-intercepts.


### Finding the Vertex of a Quadratic Relation in Standard Form

When there are no real roots, we can rewrite a quadratic relation from standard form to vertex form. This involves a process called **completing the square**. 

A quadratic is a **perfect square** if it can be written as $a(x - s)^2$. In other words, perfect squares are in the form $ax^2 + 2asx + as^2$. 

Completing the square involves taking a binomial of the form and finding what other term has to be added in order to get a perfect square.

For example, if we have $x^2 + 6x$, we can add 9 to get a perfect square since $x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2$. All we have to do is half the second term, then square it.

Here is an example of how to rewrite a quadratic relation in vertex form from standard form.

$f(x) = x^2 + 6x + 5$

$f(x) = (x^2 + 6x + 9 - 9) + 5$

$f(x) = (x^2 + 6x + 9) - 9 + 5$

$f(x) = (x + 3)^2 - 4$

This tells us that the vertex of $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + 5$ is $(-3, -4)$.

Here is another example.

$f(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 5$

$f(x) = 2(x^2 - 2x) + 5$

$f(x) = 2(x^2 - 2x + 1 - 1) + 5$

$f(x) = 2(x^2 - 2x + 1) - 2 + 5$

$f(x) = 2(x - 2)^2 + 4$

This tells us that the vertex of $2x^2 - 4x + 5$ is $(2, 1)$.


Write each of the following quadratic functions in vertex form.

1. $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 15$

2. $f(x) = 4x^2 - 4x - 2$

3. $f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 3)$
