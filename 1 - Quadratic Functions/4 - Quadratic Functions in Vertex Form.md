Quadratic Functions in Vertex Form
-------


A quadratic function is in vertex form if it is in the form f(x) =  a(x-h)^2 + k. The vertex is (h, k). The parabola opens up when *a* is positive, and opens down when *a* is negative.


### Maxima vs. Minima

All quadratic functions have either a maximum or minimum value. It has a minimum value if its *a* value in standard form or factored form is positive, and if has a maximum value if *a* is negative.

Since a parabola has vertical symmetry, the axis of symmetry goes through the vertex. 


### Finding the Roots of a Quadratic Function in Vertex Form

Recall that a quadratic function can have 0, 1, or 2 real roots.

When it has 0 roots, *a* and *k* will have the same signs. If *k* and *a* are positive, the vertex is above the x-axis and the parabola opens up. If *k* and *a* are negative, the vertex is below the x-axis and the parabola opens down. In both cases, the parabola never touches the x-axis, meaning there are no real roots.

When it has 1 root, k will be 0. This is the case when the vertex is on the x-axis, meaning it is the root.

When it has 2 roots, *a* and *k* will have the opposite sign. To find the roots, we can let the dependent variable be 0, then rearrange the equation and solve for the independent variable.

Here is an example showing how to find the roots of f(x) =  2(x - 3)^2 - 4.
0 = 2(x-3)^2 - 4 => 4 = 2(x-3)^2 => 4/2 = (x-3)^2 => ±\sqrt(2) = x-3 => ±\sqrt(2) + 3 = x. This gives (3 + \sqrt(2), 0) and (3 - \sqrt(2), 0) as the roots.

Here is the general case.
0 = a(x-h)^2 + k => -k = a(x-h)^2 => -k/a = (x-h)^2 => ±\sqrt(-k/a) = x-h => ±\sqrt(-k/a) + h = x. As we can see, this only returns real numbers when *k* and *a* have opposite signs.
