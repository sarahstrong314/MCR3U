Sketching Sinusoidal Functions
-------

### Definitions

* The **period** of a sinusoidal function is the horizontal distance of its graph after which it repeats itself.
* A **cycle** of a sinusoidal function is its shape for one period. There are many different cycles, depending on where you start.
* The **amplitude** is half the distance between the maximum value and the minimum value.
* A **phase shift** of a sine function is the 


### Transforming Sinusoidal Functions

In a function f(x) = asin(k(x – d)) + c or f(x) = acos(k(x – d)) + c

* The domain is mathbb{R}
* The range is [c - a, c + a]
* The amplitude is a
* The phase shift is d
* The period is 360°/k
* The maximum value is c + a
* The minimum value is c - a
