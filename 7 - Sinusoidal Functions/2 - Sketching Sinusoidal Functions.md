Sketching Sinusoidal Functions
-------

### Definitions

* The **period** of a sinusoidal function is the horizontal distance of its graph after which it repeats itself.
* A **cycle** of a sinusoidal function is its shape for one period. There are many different cycles, depending on where you start.
* The **amplitude** of a sinusoidal function is half the distance between the maximum value and the minimum value.
* A **phase shift** of a sinusoidal function is the horizontal shift from f(x) = sin(kx) or f(x) = cos(kx).


### Key Properties of Sinusoidal Functions

These are the key features of a sinusoidal function in the form f(x) = asin(k(x – d)) + c or f(x) = acos(k(x – d)) + c.

* The domain is \mathbb{R}.
* The range is [c - a, c + a].
* The amplitude is a.
* The phase shift is d/k.
* The period is 360°/|k|, where || denotes magnitude or absolute value.
* The maximum value is c + a.
* The minimum value is c - a.

To sketch a sine function in the form f(x) = asin(k(x – d)):

1. Plot the points (d + 90°/|k|, c + a), (d - 90°/|k|, c - a). This is a maximum value and minimum value.
2. Plot several more maxima and minima by spacing them 360°/|k| apart.
3. Plot the point (d, c). This is a point half-way between the maximum and minimum value.
4. Plot several more "half-way" points by spacing them 180°/|k| apart.
5. Connect all the points with a smooth curve.

To sketch a cosine function in the form f(x) = acos(k(x – d)):

1. Plot the points (d, c + a), (d + 180°/|k|, c - a). This is a maximum value and minimum value.
2. Plot several more maxima and minima by spacing them 360°/|k| apart.
3. Plot the point (d + 90°, c). This is a point half-way between the maximum and minimum value.
4. Plot several more "half-way" points by spacing them 180°/|k| apart.
5. Connect all the points with a smooth curve.
