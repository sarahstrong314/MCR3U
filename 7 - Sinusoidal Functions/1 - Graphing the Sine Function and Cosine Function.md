Graphing the Sine Function and Cosine Function
-------

### The Sine Function

Recall the sine values of some of the special angles.

| \theta | sin\theta |
| --- | --- |
| 0° | 0 |
| 30° | 1/2 |
| 60° | \sqrt(3)/2 |
| 90° | 1 |

Recall the following table for finding related angles.

| Quadrant of angle \theta | related angle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 1  | \theta |
| 2 | 180° - \theta | 
| 3 | \theta - 180° | 
| 4 | 360° - \theta | 

We can use this along with the CAST rule to finish the rest of the table of values using increments of 30° up to 360°.

| \theta | sin\theta |
| --- | --- |
| 0° | 0 |
| 30° | 1/2 |
| 60° | \sqrt(3)/2 |
| 90° | 1 |
| 120° | \sqrt3/2 |
| 150° | 1/2 |
| 180° | 0 |
| 210° | -1/2 |
| 240° | -\sqrt(3)/2 |
| 270° | -1 |
| 300° | -/sqrt3/2 |
| 300° | -1/2 |
| 360° | 0 |

By plotting these points and connecting them with a smooth curve, we see that the shape of the sine function resembles a wave. In fact, this shape is referred to as the **sine wave**.


### The Cosine Function

Going through the same procedure as for the sine function, we can come up with this table of values for the cosine function.

We can use this along with the CAST rule to finish the rest of the table of values using increments of 30° up to 360°.

| \theta | cos\theta |
| --- | --- |
| 0° | 1 |
| 30° | \sqrt3/2 |
| 60° | 1/2 |
| 90° | 0 |
| 120° | -1/2 |
| 150° | -\sqrt(3)/2 |
| 180° | -1 |
| 210° | -/sqrt3/2 |
| 240° | -1/2 |
| 270° | 0 |
| 300° | 1/2 |
| 330° | \sqrt(3)/2 |
| 360° | 0 |

By plotting these points and connecting them with a smooth curve, we see that it has the same shape as the sine function. We can take the graph of the sine function and translate it horizontally by 90° to get the graph of the cosine function. Note that the the y-intercept of the cosine function is (1,0), whereas for the sine function it was (0,0).
