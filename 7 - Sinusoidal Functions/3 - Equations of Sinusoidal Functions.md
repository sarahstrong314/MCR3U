Equations of Sinusoidal Functions
-------

Recall that there are exactly two solutions to sin(\theta) = x, where 0° \ge \theta < 360° and -1 \ge x \ge 1. Same goes for solutions to cos(theta) = x.

Since the sine function have a period of 360°, if sin(\theta) = x then sin(\theta + k360°) = x, for all k \in \mathbb{Z}. Same goes for the cosine function.

When we're solving a sinusoidal function for a value of \theta, there are infinitely solutions when the domain is not restricted, but we can express the set of all solutions.

For example, the solution to sin(\theta) = 1/2, 0° \ge \theta < 360°, is \theta = 30° or \theta = 150°. To express the set of all solutions to sin(\theta) = 1/2, we can write \theta = 30° + k360°, k \in \mathbb{Z}) or \theta = 150° + k360°, k \in \mathbb{Z}).
